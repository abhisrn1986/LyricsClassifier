Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right

Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

I know that ooh, birds fly in different directions
Ooh, I hope to see you again

Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Death will make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

I know that ooh, birds fly in different directions
Ooh, I hope to see you again
Ooh, birds fly in different directions
Ooh, so fly high, so fly high

When the moon is lookin' down
Shinin' light upon your ground
I'm flyin' up to let you see
That the shadow cast is me

I know that ooh, birds fly in different directions
Ooh, I hope to see you again
Ooh, birds fly in different directions
Ooh, so fly high, so fly high
Ooh, so fly high, so fly high
Ooh, so fly high, so fly high"
1,bad liar,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/37279096/Imagine+Dragons/Bad+Liar,"Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don't prey on 
Innocent victims
Trust me, darling, trust me darling
It's been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith and 
Crocodile tears
Trust me, darling, trust me, darling

So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape
I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go (go)

Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I've been askin' 
Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling) 
Problems, problems, problems

So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape
I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me

I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

Oh
Please believe me
Please believe me"
2,heart upon my sleeve,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/37541500/Imagine+Dragons/Heart+Upon+My+Sleeve,"With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken

Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, whoa

I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it
I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it

With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down

Now, I can't go a single day without thinking of the words I'd say
And I can't do a single thing without thinking of you, thinking of you

Now I'm just left with the pieces to put back together
(Together, together, together)
(Forever, forever, forever)

With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down"
3,thunder,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/35184232/Imagine+Dragons/Thunder,"Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the back seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nose bleeds

Thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun', thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder

4,whatever it takes,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/37053664/Imagine+Dragons/Whatever+It+Takes,"Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"
5,born to be yours,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/35329826/Imagine+Dragons/Born+to+Be+Yours,"I know I've given up

Lost in the millions?
Or are you my grain of sand
That's blowing in the wind?

6,natural,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/37053667/Imagine+Dragons/Natural,"Will you hold the line?
When every one of them is giving up or giving in, tell me
In this house of mine?
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heartache, cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees' shadows and
What's happenin'?
Lookin' through the glass find the wrong within the past knowin'
We are the youth
Cut until it bleeds, inside a world without the peace facing
A bit of the truth, the truth

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heartache, cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Natural
Yeah, you're a natural"
7,it's time,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/37047751/Imagine+Dragons/It%27s+Time,"So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes
To ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am"

Whoa, oh, oh

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse

Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still I find you
Next to me (next to me)

There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still I find you

I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it (oh)

Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few

Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain

Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown

I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night

Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

In the eyes of a teenage crystallized
Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

I know all your reasons
To keep me from seeing
Everything is actually a mess
But now I am leaving
All of us were only dreaming
Everything is actually a mess

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess
 
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream"

Throwing me a sharp right

I could slide take a dive take it for the home team
Hey Mr. postman slip me one more green note
I've been low hit the floor looking just to make broke

And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call
It's the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down
But I am hellbound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide"

Better tell them why they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you

You'll never know what went well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you

I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but not til you move it

Now take it in but don't look down

'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
I'm on top of the world, 'ey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something

I coulda gave up then but
Then again I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Now take it in but don't look down

'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
I'm on top of the world, 'ey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
I'm on top of the world, 'ey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now

'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
I'm on top of the world, 'ey
Waiting on this for a while now

You can leave, now it's your choice

Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?

You kiss and you kiss
And you love and you love
You've got a history list and the rest is above
And if you're warm then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor
And the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is a lie
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, let's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right, right, right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?

Leave your shoes at the door, baby
I am all you adore, lately
Come with me and we will run away

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?
Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?"

Find a balance in the middle of the chaos

Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end of my mind
But holding to the thought of another time
But looking to the ways at the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't want to hear about what to do
I don’t want to do it just to do it for you

Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder

All around the world, we are one

Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?

'Cause we got the same blood, blood
We got the same blood, blood
But will it be enough, 'nuff?
Will it be enough?
We got the same heartbeat
We’re living for the same dreams
We got the same bloodstream
Where did we all go wrong? (Oh, woo)

Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?
Love, love, love, love (as darkness will throw the dawn)
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love (love is our only hope)
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love, oh

Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?
Where did we all, where did we all?
Where did we all, where did we all? (Oh)

Blood will get you further
Pain will only make your heart hard
Tossed in fury's weather
Innocence is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me?
For me

Oh, give me strength, and give me peace
Does anyone out there watching hear me?

It's just another damn part, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me

Sadness is my enemy
I fear time will age him gently
Walking by my side for all these years
Seems that we've grown friendly
Happiness is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me?
For me

Oh, give me strength, and give me peace
Does anyone out there watching hear me?

It's just another damn part, don't let it get the best of you

Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me

I won't give up
I, I won't give up
I, I won't give up
I, I won't

And it's always on her mind
She cries at the news when the shots ring out
Every single time

And no, I cannot fix it, no, I cannot make it stop

So I said, ""Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live that real life, real life?""
Oh, hey, ""Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live, yeah, real life, real life?""

Prays on her knees as the towers fold
To a God she does not know
She's begging him to stop the mess
As the Boston bombs blow (ooh)
She said, ""How could I ever believe in something
That would step aside and watch?""
And I got no words to say 'cause I think I lost my faith
But I thank you for the day when everything will be okay

But no, I cannot fix it, and I cannot make it stop

So I said, ""Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live that real life, real life?""
Oh, hey, ""Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live, yeah, real life, real life?""

I wish I had the answers
Something you could hold too
Only thing that's real to me is
You

I've been shaken wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin' hiding from the spotlight
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay

The more I stray the less I fear
And the more I reach the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
I was there but I was always leaving
I believe it, that I was never breathing
Ay, ay, ay

And the more I reach the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me

Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)

Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up)

I'm bursting like the 4th of July 
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life 
So embrace it and leave me to stray

I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)

But you, you are my life babe

We are escaping the same way

We are a part of the same play
We think we're making our own way
Circling

You don’t have to hold your head up high

Round and round
I won’t run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

We are afflicted by fiction
Building a case for eviction
Circling
Guarding a tower of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience
And patiently circling

You don’t have to hold your head up high

Round and round
I won’t run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

All the emptiness inside you
Is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose
We're setting up to fail
You don’t have to make it right
Just hold your head up high

Round and round
I won’t run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round

Till you show me what this life is for"

Fog in the air,
Just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air,
Shaking hands run through my hair,
My fears, where do I go from here?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Walking down to the waters edge,
Asking why I'm here instead of home,
Now I stand alone.
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to feel it's side
With his
Like you were here with me.

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Oh it's on the wall, it's loud,
It's in the brightest light,
It's when the world is moving.
Oh it's in the faintest cry,
It's in the lovers' eye,
It's when I need you most,
And don't you know,

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say, that I wouldn't have it any other way

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it

Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)

When the day has come
But I've lost my way around
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns gray
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)

When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To feel they're not worth hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out

I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
I'm bleeding out for you

Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single
Thing that I loved

At the roadside
We used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side
Used to show
In the moonlight
Let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away

Oh there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me
Oh let it drift away

Water to wine and the finest of sands

All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word heart breaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
Disappear dream maker, life taker

Where to look and point my view
All the things that I could be

Mocking birds and diamond rings
Oh I have thought of greater things
All the things that fly by me
All the lives that I could lead
Maybe I was born for that
Or maybe I was first to last
You could call it cowardliness
But leave me to my studied bliss
Am I just a shadow you drew?

Above the best and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies!

Promised you all that I had
Hoping that you understand
I'm far from a perfect man

'Cause honey it's been a hard year
It seems like we're going nowhere
You're crying inside your bedroom
Baby I know it's not fair

Lay with me, for one more night
I promise you, I'll make it right

I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you

I know you don't understand 
the vices that follow a man
And in your eyes I can see
the places that you'd rather be

Cause honey it's been a hard year
It seems like we're going nowhere
You're crying inside your bedroom
Baby I know it's not fair

I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you

In my darkest hour, in the dead of the night I'll make it up to you
Your hands are mine, I'll make it up to you
Promises are nothing more than fleeting thoughts
But you, you are my life babe

I'll make it up to you (every night)
I'll make it up to you
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you)
Every night, I'll make it up to you (you, you)

""One step at a time"", they say
""One trip, and you're back that way""
I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was me

I'll try hard to make this ride
I'll try hard to win this fight
""One step at a time"", they say
""One trip, and you're back that way""
I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was me

Give me strength to fight
Help me feel alive again
Make me whole inside
Instead, this hole inside is killing me
And I'm begging you

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was me"

You always say I'm wrong, I'm pretty sure I'm right
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds

Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain (Dolla Sign!)

I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society, all this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain

I been at it with my homies
It don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up take a step back, when we roll up, cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bustin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain

I'm devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal
Naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't f*ck with Lil Wayne
I'mma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train
Cause I'm a sucker for pain

Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain

More pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging

From broken home to the city beat

No we don't want to see the truth

Back when I was unafraid

Quicker than lightning, whiter than bone
If you can erase it then I can atone

Waiting up and shivering
Hate is gone and money's tight
This little home that I'm living in

While you stand and watch them

Oh oh oh, what is with you?
Oh oh oh, I've never seen this side of you
Oh oh oh, what is with you?

You'll be the worker
I'll be the soldier

Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling
Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling

I don't think it's quite the same
Just running out to feel the rain
Staring as the stars parade
Are they telling me it's gonna be okay?

You've got to live your life
While your blood is boiling
These doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

Oh oh oh, what is with you?
Oh oh oh, I've never seen this side of you

Undercover, just like a candle in the wind

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming

Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out

Every morning, I'm staring shadows in the eye
Oh good morning, will you just wait until I die?

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming

Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Tell everybody, we are fallen
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen

Even when your fire runs out
Will you start it up again?
We are fallen"

When the world has gone to sleep
You gotta get up
When doubts begin to rise
And the world is at your feet
You gotta get up

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world,
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk
And myself

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

Hold my place
Don't you give up on me
Hold on, hold on

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself"

America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America

Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise
1-7-7-6
The names upon the list
For all the ones that gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free

And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you

Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

To the tasteless underworld
To the center of your heart, oh Cleopatra is the only one you loved
To the demonstrated smile
To the lonely love child
Destination desolation, tell me when you reach the brink of life
Just a picture on your wall
Thats nice, what a metaphoric fall
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is not what I expect, this is not what I expect
I can see it in your tears and now they're crowning me the Caesar
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

That beckon us to stay
A glimmer in the distance
That gathers all the stray
And when I need it most
It breaks into a song
That runs through all my veins
And helps me to hold on

It was a long night
We ran along into the spotlight
You sang a song that made the children cry
And all the people knew my name
It was a bright light
These lands combine into a great big mass
We sang along to the very last
Oh the jury stole my fame
And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight

Oh, you look so alive
D-d-d-did you think that we'd cry tonight
Oh did you think we'd cry
Oh can you feel my heart
I think I feel it too
D-d-d-did you think that we'd die tonight
Oh did you think we'd die

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight

Take my love, take it to the valley where the golden dove
Flies it to the places where the silence screams
Fills it with the noises of our cluttered dreams

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight"

The things you say are never right
The sins of all the world lie on your head

So when you see me look the other way
Cause -ohoh- lately all I do is play
All the glasses in the world say ""come with me""

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent considering my middle name is 'shake my body'
Take us in, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body

Welcome to the land of fail
I hope you brought your soul for sale
The greeter's still at home I think he died

The land of smash and fairy tale
The truth of life is close to hell
The best you'll be is nearly dead or failed

So when you see me look the other way
Cause lately all i do is say
These the plans i make believe all come with me

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent considering my middle name is 'shake my body'
Take us in, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body

Oh, the last of all my dreams but still leave me

Screaming out in agony she gave her life for you

We've got the same old hands
We've made the same old plans

Bail out to the yellow raft
It's got a hole but we can last
We'll watch until it fades away

Time to take it over

Some were never meant to leave the ground

We've made the same old plans

Bail out to the yellow raft
It's got a hole but we can last
We'll watch until it fades away

Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground

Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground

Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground

Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground

Stop right there
I've got a hole inside my chest
And until it fills up
I won't be satisfied

Stop right there
I've got a hole inside my chest
And until it fills up
I won't be satisfied

Stop right there
I've got a hole inside my chest
And until it fills up
I won't be satisfied

Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground

Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground

It's time to take it over
Step out into the sun
It's time to take it over
And look how far we've come

We've come"

That's why I only love you part time
It's just a matter of ""Oh, don't touch me

You got me feeling like a paradigm
Your friends all want me in the meantime
It's just a matter of ""Oh, don't touch me
Don't you, don't you touch me no more""

Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed

You left me, baby, for another man
He's looking tall, he's got a deep tan
It's just a matter of ""Oh, don't touch me
Don't you, don't you touch me no more""
He's got religious with the rhinestones
Takes care of business on his cellphone
It's just a matter of ""Oh, don't touch me
Don't you dare touch me no more""
 
Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed

If you've got to go, I won't stop you
You'll hear me singing you
""Glory! Glory! Hallelujah
You've made it easy for the both of us""

If he's got a chest and some arms
He'll hear me singing you
""Glory! Glory! Hallelujah
You've made it easy for the both of us""

Listen to the breathing voices of the ones around the tomb

I want to die tonight

They say that London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for their turn to be dead
Oh, You don't love me
You don't love me like you say you do

I can take a picture, you can be a picture
Stitched into my faded black
I can take you home, or you can be a home

And I don't want to die
No, I don't want to die
Tonight

Come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in through the back door
We drift along the flooded sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying tears of sins
All dying
We're begging for a reason

Come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in through the back door
We drift along the flooded sea of muddy waters

I guess I'll move on, do the same thing
So I wrote a song to be my lullaby
Sing me to sleep at night, open my third eye

I'm not gon' lie to you, I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch?
I'm not gon' lie to you, this has been a hard year
How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go, waitin' on a miracle
Guess that's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go, turn it down and lay low
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go

Sometimes I drive a little too fast
Think I'm runnin' from demons of my past
So I wrote a song to help me slow down
Keep my mind straight, but it's a bit late

I'm not gon' lie to you, I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch?
I'm not gon' lie to you, this has been a hard year

Remember when you got sick, cancer of the bone
Everyone at school while you sittin' at home
In your wheelchair of grief, find no relief
We were there for the ups and downs and there for the constant rounds of chemo
Yeah, you know that you are our hero
You were there when I was a zero
And I swear I'll make things right before the long night
Swear I'll make things right tomorrow
But as for tonight

I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go)
Waitin' on a miracle (waitin' on a miracle)
Guess that's just the way it goes (guess that's just the way it goes)
Easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go)
Turn it down, and lay low (lay low)
It's just the way it goes (it's just the way it goes)

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
(Huh)

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)

My enemy (look, look, look, look) (yeah)

Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
I know they wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy 

Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint

Wanna make you proud of me
But slowly I'm killing me
Playing with chemistry
Floating to the ceiling
Always rocking boat 'til you die, you know, you been flyin'
Now I'm shaking your knife, sweating the sheets out
Grinding my teeth out but still the world will glamorize it all

Leave me, leave me, I'm shut it all down

You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

So this is what it feels like
I'll give you the last word
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
And this is the town, this is the place
If you are the one to give disgrace a name
So be it

And it only looks so worn out then
Just like a stranger in the candlelight

Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, and day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice

I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me

Taking a bow, lookin' so proud
Look at me now talkin' about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?

You could be the key to lead me up into the highest rung
Give me loving, keep me going 'til the midnight hour
Bring me up, lift me up to your rainbow top
Your rainbow top

My Monday, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Monday, my, my Monday
My Monday
My Monday, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do"
107,#1,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/38838511/Imagine+Dragons/%231,"Can someone take me home where I'm supposed to be?
I'm on my back again, caught up in something
Can someone take me home? I could use a friendly face
Yeah, these leechers got to go, yeah, I need a safe space

When am I gonna learn
I've got to let things go?
Watchin' my candle burn, burn

'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
I don't need no one to believe
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
These people might not see
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
Yeah, number one, two, three

You've let me down again, why am I surprised?
I'm on my back again, walkin' in the wind
I know how these things go

When am I gonna learn
I've got to let things go?
Watchin' my candle burn, burn

'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
I don't need no one to believe
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
These people might not see
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one

Still my number one
As all these years go by
Still my number one
I'm still my number

What do you take me
What do you take me for?
What do you take me for?
Do, do-do, do, do
What do you take me
What do you take me for?
Yeah, I've been here through it all
Yeah, I'm still here

'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
I don't need no one to believe
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
These people might not see
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be (I know)
I don't need no one to believe (yeah, I know)
When it's all been said and done (when it's all)
I'm still my number one (I know)
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be (I know)
These people might not see (I know)
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one

I'm still my number one
I'm still my number one"
108,tokyo,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric-lf/1363042/Imagine+Dragons/Tokyo,"Baby's got a lot of baggage
It doesn't seem to matter, it doesn't seem to matter
Got a ticket for the mid-west, just for business
But dismissed it for the interest
It was a risk just for a mistress that was a hostess on the West-Coast
Don't you see it in my eyes tonight
Baby's got a lot of baggage

Where do I have to go
To find a hottie with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you
Kimi Tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, Pay in the palms of the rock and roll

Get that dynamite
Chick-a-Boom on the down tonight
I never seem to get it right
But you can show me so politely
Now don't you see it in my eyes tonight
Get that dynamite

Where do I have to go
To find a hottie with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you
Kimi Tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, Pay in the palms of the rock and roll
 
Hey I come back to where you are
Hey I come back to where you are
Give that dynamite

Where do I have to go
To find a hottie with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you
Kimi Tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, Pay in the palms of the rock and roll

Where do I have to go
To find a hottie with a little soul?

109,all eyes,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric-lf/1363033/Imagine+Dragons/All+Eyes,"Everything you say
Is just a lie
And now I'm leaving
To the city where the people
Are awake to chase a dream
That isn't real
And we 'posed to be somethin'
That we're not
Just wanna change a lot
And sign our name after the dot

Everything you see
Is just a century of anarchy
All my corresponding colors
That symbolize the things
We can attest, arrange
We can assess, we can attain
We are the entry for entities
To entice and entertain

All eyes
They're on you
Don't deny
You've got to
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me

Take my side
Take my side
Don't look back
I'm easy
And that's a fact
You're on my mind, oh

Everything you say
Is just a lie
And now I'm leaving
To the city where the people
Are awake to chase a dream
That isn't real
And we 'posed to be somethin'
That we're not
Just wanna change a lot
And sign our name after the dot

All eyes
They're on you
Don't deny
You've got to
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me

Now will the sun come up tonight?
Because your eyes they burn so bright
I'm all you've got
When you say
That you want it all
You want it all

All eyes
They're on you
Don't deny
You've got to
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me

All eyes
They're on you
Don't deny
You've got to
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me"

But that ain't gettin us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears

And all I can do is keep on telling you
I want you, I need you
But-there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coup de Ville hiding at the bottom
Of a Cracker Jack box

I can't lie, I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
No matter how I try
I'll never be able to give you something
Something that I just haven't got
There's only one girl I'll ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back
Oh I know

I remember how she left me on a stormy night
She kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away

And she kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
I want you, I need you

(Words and Music by Bruce Neilsen)

When I want you
You seem so far away
Now that you’re near
I wish you’d disappear

For you were more precious
When you were out of reach
When you get too close babe
I can hardly speak

Love is perverse
It could be worse
It could all end
So stay a friend

Love is perverse
It could be worse
It could all end
So stay a friend

Love is perverse
Love is perverse
Love is perverse
Love is perverse

When I see your phony smile
I feel sick inside
I’d rather see you dead
Than take me for a ride

Sometimes my feelings change
And I reach out to you
Sometimes I get so bored
You have to do

Love is perverse
It could be worse
It could all end
So stay a friend

Love is perverse
It could be worse
It could all end
So stay a friend

Love is perverse
Love is perverse
Love is perverse
Love is perverse"
121,queen of hearts gone too…,https://www.lyrics.com//sublyric/5929/Michael+J/QUEEN+OF+HEARTS+GONE+TOO+SOON,"QUEEN OF HEARTS GONE TOO SOON 
Music & Lyrics: Michael J  ASCAP

She was a shooting star, something that lit up our sky,
magical and golden with grace and style.
The people called her Queen of Hearts
blessed with a special smile, that was only... only hers...

Chorus:
Then she was gone,
then she was gone, she was gone ...
Gone too soon

She was so very young when she first caught his eye,
the romance of the century could never die... they were wrong
But how it looked so beautiful as they walked down the aisle
A modern fairy-tale, prince and princess, royal babies [William & Harry]

Chorus:
Then she was gone,
their Mummy gone, she was gone ...
Gone too soon

Royal life was very hard, she had thoughts to end her life
Did she ever get a chance to find out who she really was
A product that could sell so well, hunted all the time
Acts of infidelity, feelings of unworthiness ... we saw her cry

(Extended version only: ) 
Still the people stood in crowds, to see her beauty, to see her shine
How she touched the highest ones, how she touched the least of these
Hoping she would smile at them, just for a while...

(Celtic Flute Instrumental)

Bridge:
Does never having seen you mean I never will?
I never thought your leaving would make me feel the way it did

2nd chorus:
And we shall see...with no more tears
And we may meet...with no more fears
On the other side, by-and-by* Lady Di

The little child you held so tight, the moment that you closed your eyes
Heaven has a home for you, tender arms of eternity
>But will we continue on the loving ways that she stood for?


[ Isn't life the strangest thing, how we regret... and then we just move on ]
