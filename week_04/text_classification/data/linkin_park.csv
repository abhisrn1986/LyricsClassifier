0,in the end,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/36854002/Linkin+Park/In+the+End,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter"
1,numb,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/36854011/Linkin+Park/Numb,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be"
2,runaway,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/5679255/Linkin+Park/Runaway,"Graffiti decorations
Under the sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learned were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind"
3,papercut,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/5282195/Linkin+Park/Papercut,"Why does it feel like night today?
Something in the air's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
The paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(It watches everything)
So I know now when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right beneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all the mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(It watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me (the sun)

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin (I feel the light betray me)
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back (the sun)
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within (I feel the light betray me)
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin"

Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

You love the things I say I'll do
The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong

You have to act like you're someone

5,don't stay,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/6686938/Linkin+Park/Don%27t+Stay,"Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow I need you to go

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay

Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow I need to be alone

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay

I don't need you anymore, don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day, of you wasting me away
I don't need you anymore, I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day, of you wasting me away
(With no apologies)

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you

6,somewhere i belong,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/6686939/Linkin+Park/Somewhere+I+Belong,"When this began
I had nothing to say 
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused)
And I let it all out to find that 
I'm not the only person with these things in mind (inside of me)
But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I got left to feel (nothing to lose)
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own
And the fault is my own

I want to heal, I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face (I was confused) 
Looking everywhere only to find 
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind (so what am I?)
What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me (nothing to lose)
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own
And the fault is my own

I want to heal, I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I've held so long (erase all the pain 'till it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel
Anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be
Anything 'til I break away from me
And I will break away, and find myself today

I want to heal, I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I want to heal I want to feel like I'm
Somewhere I belong
I want to heal I want to feel like I'm somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong"
7,lying from you,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/18708602/Linkin+Park/Lying+from+You,"When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can
But I can't pretend this is the way it will stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be so I'm
Lying my way from you

(No, no turning back now)
I want to be pushed aside so let me go (no, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone (no turning back now)
Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see (no, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you is me

I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in
And now you think this person really is me and I'm
(Trying to bend the truth)
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away
'Cause I'm lying my way from you

(No, no turning back now)
I want to be pushed aside so let me go (no, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone (no turning back now)
Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see (no, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you
Is me

This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this

This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this

This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this

This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this

You (no turning back now)
I want to be pushed aside so let me go (no, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone (no turning back now)
Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see (no, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you
Is me"
8,from the inside,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/36854003/Linkin+Park/From+the+Inside,"I don't know who to trust your surprise
(Everyone feels so far away from me)
Happy thoughts sift through dust and the lies
(Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit)

(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(All I ever think about is this)
(All the tiring time between)
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me)

Take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you

Tension is building inside steadily
(Everyone feels so far away from me)
Happy thoughts forcing their way out of me
(Trying not to break but I'm so tired of this deceit)
(Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet)
(All I ever think about is this)
(All the tiring time between)
(And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me)

Take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you

I won't waste myself on you
You
You
Waste myself on you
You
You

I'll take everything from the inside and throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you

Everything from the inside and just throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time I won't trust myself with you
You
You"
9,faint,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/18708815/Linkin+Park/Faint,"I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored

I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can
But sometimes I don't make sense
I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do
You face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored

You hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored
I can't feel 
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal 
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored"
10,one step closer,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/36853999/Linkin+Park/One+Step+Closer,"I cannot take this anymore
I'm saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you'll say
But you'll find that out anyway
Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to, break

Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe

And I'm about to, break"

Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super-futureesque style
The combination of a vocal caress
With lungs that gasp for breath
From emotional stress
With special effects
And a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

Composed sentences all together venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily through the sound of the source
Everybody on board with this blend
The sword with the pen
The mightiest is the weapons
Swinging right from the chin
The elevate of mental states
Long gone with the wind
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends
It's going down
Stalence emulation readily
Trekking through the weaponry
Of the pure pedigree
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be
We invent the steadily
It's going down to sub-terrestrial high
I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots
Execution of collaborative plots
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop

It's going down
The logical progression on a the timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now it's going down

12,battle symphony,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/33783879/Linkin+Park/Battle+Symphony,"I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I've been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I've been searching for the courage
To face my enemies

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony"

14,pushing me away,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/33349142/Linkin+Park/Pushing+Me+Away,"I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me, pushes me away

I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me, pushes me away

We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me, pushes me away

Pushes me away"
15,good goodbye,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/33783881/Linkin+Park/Good+Goodbye,"So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong

(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe’s
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's, gang

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)"

And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can't escape the gravity

So much more than I can carry

But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I made the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe

I’m hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head
At first hallucination
I wanna fall wide awake now
You tell me it’s alright
Tell me I’m forgiven
Tonight
But nobody can save me now
I’m holding up a light
Chasing up the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

Stare into this illusion
For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution
But nobody proved me wrong
At first hallucination
I wanna fall wide awake
Watch the ground giving way now  
You tell me it’s alright
Tell me I’m forgiven
Tonight
But nobody can save me now
I’m holding up a light
I’m chasing up the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

Been searching somewhere out there
For what’s been missing right here
I’ve been searching somewhere out there
For what’s been missing right here

I wanna fall wide awake now
So tell me it’s alright
Tell me I’m forgiven
Tonight

When you leave me, where do you go? (Where do you go?)

All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell

Talking to myself

Watching the raindrops blinking red and white
Thinking are you back on the ground
There with a fire burning in your eyes
I only halfway apologize

And I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse to go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
You will understand

After a while you may forget
But just in case the memories cross your mind
You couldn't know this when I left
Under the fire of your angry eyes
I never wanted to say goodbye

So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse to go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
You will understand

Yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up
Tried to call home but nobody would wake up
Switch your time zones can't pick the bass up
I just passed out by the time you wake up
Best things come to those who wait
And it's time to get pumped on any road you take
Don't ever have a problem make no mistake
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away

I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand

I don’t lose, I don’t win, if I’m wrong, then I’m halfway right
Used to get high with the dead end kids
Abandoned houses where the shadows live
I never been higher than I was that night
I woke up driving my car
I couldn’t see then what I see right now
The road dissolving like an an empty vow
Couldn’t remember where I’ve been that night
I knew that I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

I know what I want, but It feels like I’m paralyzed
I don’t lose, I don’t win, if I’m wrong, then I’m halfway right

Told me kid you’re going way too fast
You burn too bright, you know you’ll never last
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now
I woke up driving my car
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
I just laughed because what do they know?
Here I am, standing all alone
Because I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep

If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In a sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
We're quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there

If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In a sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
We're quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

Who cares if one more light goes out?
In a sky of a million stars

Mama always told me don’t you run
Don’t you run with scissors, son
You’re gonna hurt someone
Mama told me look before you leap
Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences
I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

Should’ve played safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn’t understand
Never could’ve planned
They made me who I am

Put your nose on paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These years you’re never getting back

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences
I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger

Ooh
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Dude, Mike is back here like playing drums, playing keyboards, guitars, rapping
And I'm like, oh, five thumbs
Do you wanna take a break from guitar and singing for a minute then?

Do you wanna take a break from it then?
Oh no I like playing guitar, it's super fun

Consuming, confusing
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling
I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in

That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again
My walls are closing in

That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

But no one would listen
Cause no one else cared
After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When I'm done here?
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

I've taken my beating
I've shared what I've made

I've never been perfect

Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed

And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest

All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are

Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed

Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug a trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
Go, stop the show
Choppy words in a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load

Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse

Can't contain him;
He knows he works
F*ck this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing

And I know that I won't be satisfied
So, why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirty dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
I bleed it out

Boxing gloves, condoms and blue blockers
Dress shoes, a Sharpie and three quarters
A football, hacky-sack, frisbee in the back and a baseball cap
Two folding chairs, adirondack
And a mini-cooler filled with healthy snacks
Beach towels, sunblock, a surfboard and a sleeping bag
Bottled water, cashew nuts, extra socks, an American flag
Old boots, paper towels, Shopgirl: A Novella
Deodorant, house keys, sweatshirt, an umbrella
A golf club, basketball, bug spray
A laundry heap, a pocket knife, a battery
These are the things in my Jeep

These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep
These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep

Hairspray, a toy car, deck of cards, and some handy wipes
A bag of trash, a shoelace, a Rubik's cube, and a flashlight
A bandanna with my name on it
A mixtape, push play on it
A toothbrush and toothpaste
A Tic-Tac in a briefcase
A dreamcatcher, a roadmap
Registration and insurance
A toy car, a rubber band and a tape of the Jimmy Hendrix Experience
A cup holder, a steering wheel, a soda can in the back seat, a phone charger, an old wallet
These are the things in my Jeep

Hi, come inside, look around my Jeep
You will find such marvelous things
A broken stapler, some crumpled paper
Prepare for adventure, inside my Jeep

These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep
These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep

These are the things, all of the things
These are the things that I keep in my Jeep
These are the things, all of the things
These are the things that I keep in my Jeep"

The higher than they climb
The harder they will fall
And we will break their bones until they fold

Got a different method

On primetime, I'ma let that bass bang though
All you fucking lames go
Yelling out the names though
Careful what you shoot, cause you might hit what you came for
(Careful what you shoot, cause you might hit what you came for)

No control
No surprise
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there
Down in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I f*ck up everything I see
Fighting in futility

No control
No surprise
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there
Down in my eye
I'm my own casualty"
30,all for nothing,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/30857044/Linkin+Park/All+for+Nothing,"Yeah, uh
So whatcha waiting for?
Anticipating more
While you debate
What it can take to instigate a war
Yeah, I've been hated more than
Time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fucking say
They didn't say before

You could never see it
Your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe
But this is take a shot time
You waiting for a purpose?
I already got mine
While you tell me ""step to it like
One, two, three, four""

And if I do what you demand (You say)
You'll let me understand (You say)
You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away (You say)
I'll have no debt to pay (You say)
I'm gonna get what I deserve

No more, obey
My debt repaid
Our trust betrayed
All for nothing, all for nothing

Came back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya'
I really don't know ya'
You talk but let me show ya'
Where to put your paranoia
You joke and I don't half a half a sucker bone to throw ya
I'm disgusted by what can make you tuck your tail below ya
And no, I'm not your soldier
I'm not taking any orders
I'm a five-star general infantry controller
Need a lesson, let me show ya'
Have you checking your composure
While I make you step to it like
One, two, three, four

And if I do what you demand (You say)
You'll let me understand (You say)
You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away (You say)
I'll have no debt to pay (You say)
I'm gonna get what I deserve

31,guilty all the same,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric-lf/5771/Linkin+Park/Guilty+All+The+Same,"Tell us all again
What you think we should be
What the answers are
What it is we can't see
Tell us all again
How to do what you say
How to fall in line
How there's no other way
But oh, we all know

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same

Show us all again
That our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared
That you have what we need
Show us all again
'Cause we cannot be saved
Cause the end is near
Now there's no other way
And oh, you will know

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

There's no one else to blame
Guilty all the same

Guilty all the same
You're guilty all the same

Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich
If he falls off his plans, he's wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split
Nonsense the same, he didn't call for this, he's filthy
Talk team, they take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty
Anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, you claim that ain't the way that he built me
Smoke scream, we're going in flames
Know as soon as they're done what the deal be
Say it's time for things to change
We arrange that dope product we built cheap
Anything if it's more to gain
Dream, manipulated like artists, it's real deep
Until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio
You record companies kill me
Try to force me to strain it, no way
They got the gall to say ""yo, how real can real be?""
You feel me? you will see, the greed will be to blame
Greedy for the fame, TV or a name
Media, the game, to me your all the same
You're guilty

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same"
32,war,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/30857041/Linkin+Park/War,"There's no peace
Only war
Victory decides who's wrong or right
It will not cease
Only grow
You better be prepared to fight

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War

There's no pain
It was there
And it has become your only right
And words you lost
In your despair
Forever black each on your life

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War, destroy you

It needs no sign to justify
Laying down your life

War, destroy you

Marchin with no steppin'
Murder with no killin'
Illin' every direction
First, no sequel
Do the math, no equal
John with no Yoko
More power, less people

And no, I'm not afraid of that
Print it in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact
To act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade
That's saved until they play it back
To slay and leave em laying on the pavement
Bang, fade to black

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose

In the wastelands of today
Where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

Roll credits, you get it
The show's done
They're talking for just talking
But meaning, they got none
None of 'em come proper
They talk like a shotgun
But how many got bred with integrity?
Not one

So no, I'm not afraid
To see these suckers hold a blade to me
Ain't no way to shake the ground
I built before you came to be
Take it how you take it
I'm the opposite of vacancy
And this is not negotiation
Y'all can hate and wait and see

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose

In the wastelands of today
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose

When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away

That you don't know what you've got
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

I thought I kept you safe and sound
I thought I made you strong
But something made me realize
That I was wrong

'Cause finding what you got sometimes
Means finding it alone
And I can finally see your light
When I let go

'Cause you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

I've seen the broken
The lost and the sights unseen
I want a flood
I want an ocean
To wash my confusion clean

I can't resolve this empty story
I can't repair the damage done

We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion

We act it out
We wear the colors
Defined by the things we own
We're not without
We're like each other
Pretending we're here alone

And far away, they burn their buildings
Right in the face of the damage done

We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion (Rebellion, rebellion)

Rebellion, rebellion
We lost before the start
Rebellion, rebellion
One by one we fall apart
We fell apart, we fell apart, we fell apart

We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of imitations of

Who've never faced oppression's gun

If the ghosts of yesterday
If we can't let go whenever, say goodbye
No trace of what remains
No stones to mark the graves
Only memories we thought we could deny

There's so much more to lose
Than the pain I put you through
And my carelessness left you in the dark
And the blood may wash away
But the skies will never fade
At least I know somehow I made a mark

In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right

In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right"

With words you wouldn't say
Suddenly tomorrow's
Moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
We both keep on waiting
For something we won't find

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Skies begin to fade
You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade

All I ever wanted
Secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted
The truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness
And you can't see the crime
And we both keep on waiting
For what we left behind

The light on the horizon
Was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Skies begin to fade
You said it was forever

We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they
They told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time
But little did we know

Today, I looked for a sign
With flames in my hands
A line in the sand
Between yours and mine
And it came like fire from below
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall
But little did you know

Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll tell them give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine

I had never been a coward
I had never seen blood
You had sold me an ocean
And I was lost in the flood
We were counting on a leader
We were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation
And we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper
We were waiting on a wire
So we never saw it coming
When you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation
And you can try to ignore
But when the time comes calling
Yeah, you are gonna get yours

Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll tell them give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine

And so today, your truth has come
You’re gonna pay for what you’ve, pay for what you've done
You’ll get what’s yours, you’re out of time
And you will give me back what’s mine
Give me back what’s mine
Give me, give me back what's mine
What's mine
Give me, give me back what's mine
What's mine, what's mine
Give me back what's mine

Today, we stood on the wall

We laughed at the guns

Stood up strong in spite of that hate

Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A king can only reign 'til instead
There comes that day it's ""off with his head""

The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone

Never gonna be another one, no

So conditioned I could never let go
Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid I couldn't let myself see
That I could never be held
Back up, no, I'll hold myself
Check the rep, yep you know my rail
Forget the rest let them know my hell
Damn, I'm back yep, my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up the vets stay their
Let the rest be to tell they tale
That I was there saying

And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go

Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's it working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there saying

In these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go

No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up, and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how
I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know go hard!
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time, saying

And these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through

Show me how to be whole again

Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

For you to see

These snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em
Keep 'em waiting in the shadows there, thinking they hidden

Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone

This in between us is getting thinner now
Into winter now, bitter sweet
Across that horizon this sun is setting down
You're forgetting now, it's time you let me go, let me go

Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone

And tell them I couldn't help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh, tell me I am the only one
And there's nothing left to stop me

When the lights go out and we open our eyes,
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone

To burn it down
We can't wait

You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring
You lost that right, to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down

I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style, like an eight of eight drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it

Like that

It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view
Like that

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

This is something for your people on the block to
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need
Like Papa, who shot ya
Seperate the weak from the obsolete
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that

We swim against the rising waves
That crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more

So rest your head
It's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
And sings again no more
'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more"
49,skin to bone,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/28763756/Linkin+Park/SKIN+TO+BONE,"Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Will tomorrow have it's way
With the promises we made
Skin to bone, steel to rust.

Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Your deception, my disgust
When your name is finally drawn,
I'll be happy that you're gone
Ash to ashes, dust to dust.

(Aah) Ash to ashes, dust to dust
(Aah) Skin to bone and steel to rust

Right to left, left to right
Night to day and day to night
As the starlight fades to gray,
I'll be watching far away
Right to left and left to right

(Aah) Ash to ashes, dust to dust
(Aah) Skin to bone and steel to rust

Will tomorrow have it's way
With the promises betrayed
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust"
50,with you,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/5679253/Linkin+Park/With+You,"I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So, even though you're close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
With you

You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

With you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes"
51,by myself,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/28561672/Linkin+Park/By+Myself,"What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself (myself)

I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To end things watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer
By myself (myself)

I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To end things watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

How do you think
I've lost so much
I'm so afraid
I'm out of touch
How do you expect
I will know what to do
When all I know
Is what you tell me to

Don't you
I can't tell you how to make it
No matter what I do
How hard I
I can't seem to convince myself
I'm stuck on the outside
Don't you
I can't tell you how to make it
No matter what I do
How hard I
I can't seem to convince myself
I'm stuck on the outside

I can't hold on
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(To anything watching everything spin)
Without some failure sinking

I can't hold on
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(To anything watching everything spin)
Without some failure sinking"
52,a place for my head,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/28561670/Linkin+Park/A+Place+for+My+Head,"I watch how the moon
sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do
Favors and then rapidly, you just
Turn around and start asking me about
Things you want back from me
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd
Wear out your welcome now you see
How quiet it is all alone
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand

I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy

Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Shut up

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place, to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest"
53,forgotten,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/37649860/Linkin+Park/Forgotten,"From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care?

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care?

There's a place so dark you can't see the end
(Skies cock back) and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut looking through the rust and rot, and dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care?

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Moving all around
Screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go 'round and the sunset creeps
Behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care?

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care?

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you that I see it right through you

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up"

56,hit the floor,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/18708817/Linkin+Park/Hit+The+Floor,"There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you well I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind
Afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down
But I've had too many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand
So I wait till the upper hand is mine

One minute you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Making your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Making your heart stop
You think you've won
And then it's all gone

So many people like me that put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on
There are so many things you say that make me feel you cross the line
What goes up will surely fall, and I am counting down the time
'Cause I've had so many standoffs with you it's about as much as I could stand
So I waiting until the upper hand is mine

One minute you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Making your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Making your heart stop
You think you've won
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
Now it's all gone

I know I'll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide us, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

One minute you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Making your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Making your heart stop
You think you've won
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
Now it's all gone"
57,easier to run,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/18708806/Linkin+Park/Easier+To+Run,"It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Something has been taken from deep inside of me
A secret I've kept locked away
No one can ever see
Wounds so deep they never show
They never go away
Like moving pictures in my head
For years and years they've played

If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would
If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
I would take all the shame to the grave

It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past

If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would
If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
I would take all the shame to the grave

Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
Is so much simpler than change

It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

It's easier to run
If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made
It's easier to go
If I could change I would take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could stand up and take the blame I would
I would take all the shame to the grave"

I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words I can say I
Put all pain you gave to me on display

Took what I hated and made it a part of me

Hearing your name the memories come back again
I remember when it started happening
I see you n' every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committing myself to em n' everyday
I regret saying those things 'cause now I see that I

I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than any time before
I have no options left again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit

I'm breaking the habit tonight"
60,nobody's listening,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/18708811/Linkin+Park/Nobody%27s+Listening,"Come, come, come, coming at you
Come, coming at you
Come, coming at you, yo

Peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is how could you ignore it
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like (rewind that)
We're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime there are those who want to
Talk this and that, so I suppose that
It gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt, it goes

Try to give you warning but everyone ignores me
(Told you everything loud and clear)
But nobody's listening, call to you so clearly
But you don't want to hear me
(Told you everything loud and clear)
But nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger, held in my chest
And everything's left is a waste of time
I hate my rhymes (but hate everyone else's more)
I'm riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that it's better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years
The fear and trash talking
And the people it was to
And the people that started it
Just like you

Try to give you warning but everyone ignores me
(Told you everything loud and clear)
But nobody's listening, call to you so clearly
But you don't want to hear me
(Told you everything loud and clear)
But nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger, held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear

A heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger, held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear

A heart full of pain, a heart full of pain
Try to give you warning but everyone ignores me
(Told you everything loud and clear)
But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly but you don't want to hear me
(Told you everything loud and clear)
But nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Nobody's listening
Handful of anger, held in my chest
Nobody's listening
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nobody's listening
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Nobody's listening

Come, come, come, coming at you
Come, come, come, coming at you
Come, come, come, coming at you
Come, come, come, coming at you from every side"

62,enth e nd,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric-lf/3948691/Linkin+Park/Enth+E+ND,"Hey yo when this first started up, it was just Linkin Park
and then in the middle, came Motion Man
and at the end of it all, it was Kutmaster Kurt with a remix.

One thing I don't know why
it doesn't even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time.
all I know, time was just slipping way
and I watched it count down till the end of the day
watched it watch me and the words that I say
the echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look down below
and I watched the time go right out the window
trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
but in the end no matter what I pretend
the journey is more important than the end or the start
and what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of the time when 

I tried so hard
and got so far
but in the end
it doesn't even matter
I had to fall
to lose it all
but in the end
it doesn't even matter

hey yo one thing, one thing I don't know why
it doesn't even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time
all I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party
all for shake and made eye contact
party control showing all that
northeast, southwest coast
stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle
I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder
I brought you back of the thing
like the imaginary man of your dreams
well, you would always seem to make it worth it
a sleek skin I never nerved you
you felt lovin, I never applied a room
without bringing the plan
by any means and means of leaving you teens,
of all those teenage scenes

I tried so hard
and got so far
but in the end
it doesn't even matter
I had to fall
to lose it all
but in the end
it doesn't even matter

Linkin park, remix, Motion Motion Motion Man
Linkin park, in the end, the end, Kutma Kutma Kut Kutmasta Kurt
Linkin park, remix, Motion Motion Motion Man
Linkin park, in the end, the end, Kutmasta Kurt remix

one thing I don't know how
it doesn't even matter when you look at it now
because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all
scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl
and I was forced to run, with you mocking me
stopping me, back stabbing me constantly
remembering all the times you fought with me
watch the clock now chock full of hypocrisy
and now your mouth wishes it could inhale
every single little thing you said to make things fair
every single little sputter just to get your piece,
but it really doesn't matter to me
because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend
the journey is more important than the end or the start
and what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of the time when 

I tried so hard
and got so far
but in the end
it doesn't even matter
I had to fall
to lose it all
but in the end
it doesn't even matter..
in the end…"

Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

We're stuck in a place so dark, you could hardly see
A manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
Duck away into the darkness, times up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs
And nauseated by the polluted rock that's all around
Watchin' the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows and captures the eye
And cries out a yellow light as it passes me by
And a young, shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rock with antennas on top
Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The same lose, not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change, the box stays the same
And the figure inside could bear anybody's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday I'm hopin' to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me

I'm here at the podium talking, the ceremonial offerings
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring
What's happened
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants, causin' urban collapsing
Bullets that scar souls, with dark holds, get more than your car stole
Some hearts be blacker than charcoal
For real, this society's deprivation depends not on our differences,
but the separation within
No preparation is made, limited aid, minimum wage
Livin' in a tenement cage for innocent pay
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspread like permanent plague
I'm the forgotten

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up"

There's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes
Staring back at me

Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down

I've lied
To you
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind)
For sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

I've tried
Like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

Reverse phsycology's failing miserably
It's so hard to be, left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
there's nothing left but, to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking why...
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie (why)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me
Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me"

I watch how the moon
Sits in the sky on a dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give the light to the moon
Assuming the moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors then rapidly
You just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me

I'm sick of the tension
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

Take it the john your Babylon
Flush down with the sound that you carry on

Took a dump like a punk

So sick of you stressing

Find another place to feed your face
If you don't we gonna bump get it up get crunk

Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekanetic psychology
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces, cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinite, let icon be bygones
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the guantlett with whoever that wants this

Never satisfied my rhymes jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A
On highways write with road rage
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics
Forth dimension, compact convention
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention
Ment to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out at your flaws
Spitting rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw

Roving over man's bolding when he's jammin your plans ova

When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage
That's why I need ruby corks glasses, cause when I glance at the chest
Then I might blast the masses
Subliminals transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano
My IU skills are when I mean plea sees the rhyme I hear as I proceed through time
I walk through the walls and the inanimate obstacles
While educed to the reduction of cells and molecules

Hey, Mike, what's up?
This is Roc, just asking you what's happening?

Um, just seeing if you're going to see Joe sometime soon, too,

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me
I'm with you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
Ugh!

I hit you and you hit me back
And we fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong, I pretend the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you're close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me
I'm with you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)

(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
Ugh!

(No)
I won't let you control my fate while I'm holding the weight of the world on my conscience
(No)
I won't just sit here and wait while you weighin' your options
Your makin' a fool of me
(No)
You didn't dare to try and say you don't care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
(No)
It ain't like me to beg on my knees
Or, please oh baby please
that's not how I'm doin' things
(No)
No I'm not upset, no I'm not angry
I know love is love and love sometimes, it doesn't pay me
(No)
I'm never without you, I'll always be with you
You'll never forget me, I'm keeping you with me
(No)
I won't let you take me to the end of my row
Or keep burning and torching my soul
(No)
No I'm not your puppet
And no, no, no, I won't let you go

No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I, I can't wait to see tomorrow

With you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)
With you
(You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you
(You, now I see, keeping everything inside)

Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Hey yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind
But I find myself in places with names but no faces
My memory races at speeds hundred degrees
My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the flames

All I'm trying to do is just master me
All I want to do is smoke a blaster beat
But something keeps talking to me consciously
Responsibly it keeps haunting me
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another verse
There's nothing worse the trying to pull yourself back up from the dead
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The the face inside is right beneath your skin
The the the face inside is right beneath your skin
The-face-inside-is-right-beneath-your-skin!

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down

It's like I'm paranoid! (echoes)
I feel the light betray me
The sun

Can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

Myself!

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch 'em red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade but then
I just end up getting hurt again

By myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't look around
It's too much to take in
I can't hold back
When I'm stretched so thin
I can't slow down
Watching everything spin
I can't look back
Starting over again

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

By myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't look around
It's too much to take in
I can't hold back
When I'm stretched so thin
I can't slow down
Watching everything spin
I can't look back
Starting over again

In your, in your, in your, in your sound institute
Of invention of reliable audio weapon system

Let's, let's try, let's try, let's try something else

Folks, we have a very special guest for you tonight
Tonight, tonight break it down

Using the waves of sound a true master paralyzes
His opponent, leaving him vulnerable to an attack, Mr Hahn

78,1stp klosr,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/19272812/Linkin+Park/1stp+Klosr,"(I'm about to break)

I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again (over and over again, over and over again, over and over again, over and over again)
Just like before

Everything you say to me
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I'm about to break

These are the places where I can feel 
Torn from my body, my flesh, it peels 
During this ride, we can cut up what we like (I'm about to break)

Waiting alone, I cannot resist
Feeling this hate, I have never missed
Please, someone, give me a reason to rip off my face
Blood is a pouring and pouring and pouring and pouring and pouring and pouring
And pouring and pouring and pouring and pouring

Shut up when I'm talking to you, shut up
Blood is pouring (shut up)
Blood is pouring (shut up)
Blood is pouring, shut up when I'm talking to you (shut up)
Blood is pouring (shut up)
Blood is pouring (shut up)
Blood is pouring (shut up)
I'm about to break

Everything you say to me (and I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe (and I'm about to break)

Everything you say to me (and I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe (and I'm about to break)

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge and I'm about to"

*faint* Crawling in my skin
(Without a sense of confidence)
*faint* Consuming, Confusing...
Crawling in my skin
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface...

Ah, Crawling in my skin, (Crawling in my skin)
These wounds, they will not heal... (Wound, they will not heal)
Fear is how I fall, (fear is how I fall)
Confusing... Confusing what is real...
Confusing what is real...

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing,
This lack of self-control, I fear, is neverending.
Controlling, I can't seem
to find myself again. My walls are closing in...
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take.)
I've felt this way before, SO INSECURE!!!

Crawling in my skin,
these wounds, they will not heal.
Fear is how I fall,
Confusing what is real.

Discomfort, endlessly, has pulled itself upon me,
distracting, reacting,
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection,
It's haunting, how I can't seem...
To find myself again, my walls are closing in.
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take!)
I've felt this way before, SO INSECURE!!!
*Hold 1.5 times longer than last time*

Without a sense of confidence, (confidence)
Without a sense of confidence, (confidence)
Without a sense of Confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take.
Without a sense of confidence, (confidence)
Without a sense of confidence, (confidence)
Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take.

Seem to find myself again, My walls are closing in...

Start and crush your nails
And start all over again
Could this all just be a dream

Wake Me, Wake Me

Without that blind in my sight
Could this all just be a dream

Another day's been laid to waste
In my disgrace
Stuck in my head again 
Feels like I'll never leave this place
There's no escape

I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say
Take this all away
I'm suffocating
Tell me what the f**k is wrong with me

I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared
I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow somewhere
And no one cares

I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say
Take this all away
I'm suffocating
Tell me what the f**k is wrong 
with me

Put me out of my misery
Put me out of my misery
Put me out of my
Put me out of my f**king misery

I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

What I've done

84,hands held high,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/17939877/Linkin+Park/Hands+Held+High,"Turn my mic up louder
I got to say something
Lightweights stepping aside
When we come in
Feel it in your chest
The syllables get pumping
People on the street
They panic and start running
Words on loose leaf
Sheet complete coming
I jump on my mind
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping
Healing the blind
I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways
We march to the drumming
Jump when they tell us
They want to see jumping
F*ck that, I want to
See some fist pumping
Risk something
Take back what's yours
Say something that you know
They might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated
Like I had before
Like it's stupid standing for
What I'm standing for
Like this war is really just
A different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater the rich
And an abandon the poor
Like they understand you
In the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughing their way
To the bank and cashing their check
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect

For a leader so nervous
In an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling
For nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world
Watching at the end of the day
In the living room laughing
Like what did he say?

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen

In my living room watching
But I am not laughing
'Cause when it gets tense
I know what might happen
The world is cold
The bold men take action
Have to react
Or get blown into fractions
Ten years old is something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he thought the ""next one could be me""
Do you see?
The soldiers they're out today
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic
At times like this you pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling
For nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world
Watching at the end of the day
Both scared and angry
Like what did he say?

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen

With hands held high
Into a sky so blue
As the ocean opens up
To swallow you

With hands held high
Into a sky so blue
The ocean opens up
To swallow you

With hands held high
Into a sky so blue
The ocean opens up
To swallow you

With hands held high
Into a sky so blue
The ocean opens up
To swallow you

With hands held high
Into a sky so blue
The ocean opens up
To swallow you

With hands held high
Into a sky so blue
The ocean opens up
To swallow you"

Your crusade's a disguise?
Replaced freedom with fear
You trade money for lives
I'm aware of what you've done

No, no more sorrow

Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

I see pain, I see need
I see liars and fiends
Abuse power with greed
I had hope, I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived
You will pay for what you've done!

No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced!

Thieves and hypocrites!
Thieves and hypocrites!
Thieves and hypocrites!

And blew away as I collapsed, so cold

A black wind took them away from sight
And now the darkness over day, that night
And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

I used to be my own protection, but not now
Cause my path has lost direction, somehow
A black wind took you away from sight
And now the darkness over day, that night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

So now you're gone, and I was wrong
I never knew what it was like to be alone

On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day
On a Valentine's Day (I used to be my own protection)
On a Valentine's Day (but not now)
On a Valentine's Day ('Cause my mind has lost direction
On a Valentine's Day (somehow)
On a Valentine's Day (I used to be my own protection
On a Valentine's Day (but not now)

Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me
I'm awfully underrated

And so this second I'm gonna save it for the record

This is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone
And the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within 'em

We say, ""yeah""
With fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear
Until we get, forget it
Let it all disappear

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

(Oh) I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

(Oh) I know what it takes to move on

I know how it feels to lie
All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Yeah, yeah
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I've said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, picking up the pieces, now where to begin?
The hardest part of ending is starting again

All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end
This is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone
And the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within 'em
(Holding on to what I haven't got)

We say, ""yeah""
With fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it
Let it all disappear
(Holding on to what I haven't got)"
98,blackout,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/24426030/Linkin+Park/Blackout,"I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and never say

No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down
You push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down black out blood in your eye

You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and take and take
F*ck it are you listening?

No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down
You push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down
You push it back down
No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down
You push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down
Black out blood in your eye

Floating down, as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground
In fields of paper white
And floating up you pass us in the night
A future gazing out a past to overwrite
So come down far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

Come down
Oh
Come down
Oh
Come down
Oh
Come down
Oh
Come down
Oh"

Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
You can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you've got to make it stop

To save face, how low can you go?
Talk a lotta game, but yet you don't know
Static on the wind, makes us all say whoa
The people up top push the people down low
Get down, and obey every word
Steady, get in line if you haven't yet heard
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt
If you haven't heard yet, then I'm lettin' you know
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
And no one make a move, unless my people say so
Got everything outta control, now everybody go

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Feel alone, final blow
We, the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and tall
Wretches and kings, we come for you

So keep face, how slow can you go?
Talk a lotta shit, and yet you don't know
Fire on the wind, makes you all say whoa
The people up top and the people down low
Get down, and I'm runnin' it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi-hat
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I'm lettin' them know
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no
So push the button, let the whole thing blow
Spinning everything outta control, now everybody go

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Feel alone, final blow
We, the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and tall
Wretches and kings, we come for you
Still alone, fight our blow
Filthy animals beat down low
Steel and bone, black and blue
Run at the sunshine, we come for you

From the front to the back and to side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high

And you've got to indicate to the people, run in to the people on it
And unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all

Because my conscience leaves me no other choice
A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war
This way of settling difference is, is not just
This business of burning human beings with napalm
Filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows
Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of peoples normally humane

Of sending men home from the dark and bloody battlefields
Physically handicapped and psychologically deranged
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love

You were waiting on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down, insides crying save me now
You were there impossibly alone.

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation
You build up hope but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go.

And in the burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of temper grace falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation
You build up hope but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go.

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation
You build up hope but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go."

They'll see you to you
They'll be your guide
Back home where life leaves us blind

It keeps us kind

When you suffered it all
And your spirit is breaking
You're growing desperate from the fight
Remember your love
And you always will be
This melody will always bring
You right back home

When life leaves us blind
Love, keeps us kind
When life leaves us blind

I can't concentrate, searching for a message
In the fear and pain, broken down and waiting
For the chance to feel alive

Now in my remains
Our promises that never came
Except this silent rain
To wash away the worst of me

Come apart, falling in the cracks
Of every broken heart, digging through the wreckage
Of your disregard, sinking down and waiting
For the chance, to feel alive

Now in my remains
Our promises that never came
Except this silent rain
To wash away the worst of me

Like an army, falling
One by one by one
Like an army, falling
One by one by one
Like an army, falling
One by one by one

There's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes
Staring back at me

Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down

I've lied
To you
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind)
For sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

I've tried
Like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

Reverse phsycology's failing miserably
It's so hard to be, left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
there's nothing left but, to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking why...
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie (why)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me
Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me"

I hate when you say you don't understand,
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.

I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night,
Shining with the light from the sun,
The sun doesn't give light to the moon,
Assuming the moons gonna owe it one,
And makes think of how you act to me, you do favors that rapidly,
You just turn around and start asking me about things you want back from me,
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger,
Sick of you acting like I owe you this,
Find another place to feed your greed,
While I find a place to rest, I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger,
Sick of you acting like I owe you this, find another place to feed your greed,
While I find a place to rest.

I want to be in another place, I hate when you say you don't understand,
I want to be in the energy, right with the enemy, a place for my head.
I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to

Two Two Three Three Ya Ya Ya
Gimme energon to keep me calm
You and your mom keep on the drom
Used to be a team, passed that baton
But you flop that bod as you drop that bomb
Take it to the john in your babylon
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on.
I don't really give a dang you pissed on my lawn
Took a dump like a punk now the battles on.

So sick of you stressin'
Sick of you fessin'
Sick of you actin' like I owe you some
Find another place to feed your face
If you don't we gonna bump, get it up, get crunk.

Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Hey yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind
But I find myself in places with names but no faces
My memory races at speeds hundred degrees
My soul it bleeds devil must have planted the seed
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust their screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the flames

All I'm trying to do is just master me
All I want to do is smoke a blaster beat
But something keeps talking to me consciously
Responsibly it keeps haunting me
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another verse
There's nothing worse the trying to pull yourself back up from the dead
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The the face inside is right beneath your skin
The the the face inside is right beneath your skin
The-face-inside-is-right-beneath-your-skin!

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down

It's like I'm paranoid! (echoes)
I feel the light betray me
The sun

Can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside it's right right beneath the skin"

The lightning all around me
I remember each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing inside
The memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

When I'm done here?
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating
I've shared what I've made
I'm strong on the surface
Not all the way through
I've never been perfect
But neither have you
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are
I can't be who you are"

Thank you, thank you, thank you
You're far too kind

Can I get an encore, do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waiting for?

After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, make some noise

Get em Jay

Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearing me rap is like hearing G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the Blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the f*ck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand opening, grand closing
God damn your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you goin' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you goin' see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Can I get an encore, do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waiting for?

After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, make some noise

What the hell are you waiting for?

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearing the 4-5
It ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowing you to smithereens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So motherfucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, till your lungs get sore

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless
Lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure
Of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow
Just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow
Just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you

I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more? (More, more, more)

I've become so numb
For one last time I need y'all to roar (One last time I need y'all to roar)"

Can't f*ck with me 
They ain't ready yet 
Uh-huh uh-huh 
Yeah, yeah 
Motherfuckers want to act loco, hit em wit, numerous 
Shots with the fo'-fo' 
Fagots running to the Po-Po's, smoke em like cocoa 
F*ck rap, coke by the boatload 
F*ck dat, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed 
Left holes through some guy clothes 
Stop your bullshitting, glock with the full clip 
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit 
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip 
See the nigga laying shocked when the bullet hit 
And hey ma, how you, know niggas want to buy you 
But see me I want to ""F*ck for Free"" like Akinyele 
Take this ride 'til you feel it inside ya belly 
If it's tight get the K-why Jelly 
All night get you wide up inside the telly 
Side to side, til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me

I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard 
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact 
That everybody can see these scars 
(I am)
What I want you to want, what I want you to feel 
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you 
To just believe this is real 
(So I)
Let go watching you turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I'm not 
That's all I give cause you're all that I've got 

Got a condo with nuttin' but condoms in it 
The same place where the rhymes is invented 
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke 
See how I was flowing on my last cassette? 
Rapid-fire like I'm blasting a Tec, never jam though 
Never get high, never run out of ammo 
Niggas hating n shit cause I slayed your bitch 
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick 
And now you're, acting raw but you never had war 
Don't know how to carry your hoe, want to marry your hoe 
Now she's mad at me, cause Your Majesty, just happened to be 
A pimp with a tragedy 
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked her friend 
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again 
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, ""Shit.. 
There's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!"" 

I am, a little bit insecure, a little un-confident 
But you don't understand I do what I can 
Sometimes I don't make sense 
I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt 
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out 
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do 
You face away and pretend that I'm not 
But I'll be here cause you're all that I've got 

I can't feel the way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal this damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored

Now hear me out now 
You're gonna listen to me like it or not 
Right now, hear me out now 
You're gonna listen to me like it or not 
Right now 

I can't feel the way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal this damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored
I can't feel (the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me) I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored"
120,we made it,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/18854286/Linkin+Park/We+Made+It,"Together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall 

See you survived the worst but my life is glorious 
Betta know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious 
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness now you can call me Morpheus 
As for securing the win, better believe I'm so notorious 
You know that I've been buying my bread even though we rapping now (yes) 
We use to live on the strip and even though we're a higher level tramping now 
Superceded everyone of my middle struggles and 
Failure never ever has been an option 
A paper long like we was on the trap and we bout ta take the hood shoppin' 
Get it! 

Together we made it (you see we did it did it) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (come on) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
But we took it on the road (to the riches) 
On the road (to the ghetto) 
On the road (in the project to this bangin instrumental) 
On the road (ride with me) *yeah 
On the road (you come and get it) *yeah, yeah* 
On the road *yeah, yeah, yeah, yo!* 

When it all got started we was steadily just getting rejected 
And it seemed like nothing we could do would ever get us respected 
At best we were stressed and the worst they probably said we're pathetic 
Had all the pieces to that puzzle just no way to connect it 
And I was fighting through every rhyme tightening up every line 
Never resting the question if I was out of my mind 
And it finally came time to do it or let it die 
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride 
Sing it! 

Together we made it (you see we did itit did it) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (come on) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
But we took it on the road (to the riches) 
On the road (to the ghetto) 
On the road (in the projects to this bangin instrumental) 
On the road (ride with me) 
On the road (you come and get it) 
On the road 

Look in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm building 
Things that I could leave for my children (children) children (children) 
Now I only wake up with a smile to see how far I've come 
Fighting for sales on a strip to get the hustle from 
From nights in jail on a bench using my muscles son 
To counting money like Dre and Jimmy or Russell Ross 
But now I live what I dream you see we finally did it 
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you did it 
Sing it 

Together we made it (you see we did it did it) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (come on) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
But we took it on the road (to the riches) 
On the road (to the ghetto) 
On the road (in the projects to this bangin instrumental) 
On the road (ride with me) 
On the road (you come and get it)

Through the windows, up the stairs

Chilling rain
Like an ocean everywhere

Don't want to reach for me do you
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away

And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you

And six feet under water
I
Do

Hope decays
Generations disappear

Washed away
As a nation simply stares

How did I fall so far behind'
Why am I searching for perfection
Knowing it's something I won't find'

In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because I run
'Til the silence splits me open, I run
'Til it puts me underground
'Til I have no breath
And no roads left but one

When did I lose my sense of purpose'
Can I regain what's lost inside'
Why do I feel like I deserve this'
Why does my pain look like my pride'

In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because I let myself down

Buried beneath all the lies
And I stood at a distance
To feel who you are
Hiding myself in your eyes

And hold on before it's too late
Until we leave this behind
Don't fall just be who you are
It's all that we need in our lives

And the risk that might break you
Is the one that would save
A life you dont live is still lost
So stand on the edge with me
Hold back your fear and see
Nothing is real til it's gone

And hold on before its too late
Until we leave this behind
Don't fall just be who you are
It's all that we need in our lives

So live like you mean it
Love til you feel it
It's all that we need in our lives
So stand on the edge with me
Hold back your fear and see
Nothing is real til it's gone

Hold on before its too late
Until we leave this behind
Don't fall just be who you are

Hold on before its too late

When I pretend, I can't forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can, but
I can't pretend that this is they way it'll stay, I'm just (trying to bend the truth)

Middle finger to the law, nigga grippin' my balls
Said the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin
All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
And watches everything

So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right beneath my skin

Rap critics that say he's ""Money, Cash, Hoes""
He's from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
So f*ck critics, you can kiss the whole asshole
If you don't like the lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if we don't play they show
They don't play our hits, we don't give a shit, so!

So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers!

Bounce on the Devil, put the pedal to the floor (c'mon!)
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case

Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Or do I look like a mind reader sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo'?

License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carryin' a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are)
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my papers legit
(Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?)
Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
(Aren't you sharp as a tack!
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or somethin'?)
Ha, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit

But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'mma get to clappin' and
He and his boys gon' be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again

I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
(I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!)
I need a little room to breathe
(I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!)

Ladies and gentlemen, put our hands together for the astonishing

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world
The flow o' the century, always timeless, HOV!
Thank you for coming out tonight
You could of been anywhere in the world, but you're here with us
We appreciate that, uh

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Boy and we got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers I was burping 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. want to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me is not real to me
Therefore he doesn't exist
So ****, vamoose son of a *****

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem get your damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty y'all gotta feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A (Check it out)
Yo, It starts with one thing

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on and didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
LP, Jay-Z, Help me out
We'll have a good old time out there
It starts with
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
LP, Jay-Z, Help me out
We'll have a good old time out there
It starts with
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

It's goin' down
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The meltin' pot of a super-futuresque style
The combination of a vocal caress
With lungs that gasp for breath from emotional stress
With special effects and a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

It's goin' down
A logical progression on the timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey, now

Composed sentences all together venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily through the sound of the source
Everybody on board as we blend the sword with the pen
The mightiest of weapons swingin' right from the chin
The elevate of mental states long gone with the wind
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends
It's goin' down
Style assimilation, readily
Trekkin' through the weaponry of a pure pedigree
Cleverly seein' through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be, we're advancin' steadily
It's goin' down to sub-terrestrial hot
I rhyme regiment that's callin' the shots
Execution of collaborative plots
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop

It's goin' down
A logical progression on the timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey, now 

It's goin' down, put it out for the world to see

I've been digging into crates ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
Mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I could start blessing it
And chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double helixes
And show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness on all of the MCs that hate us
So try on (try it), leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones

I firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit, with or without an accomplice (Mixed Media)

Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out

(Akira) I put a kink in the backbones of clones
With microphones, never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
Blood type Krylon, Technicolor type A

On highways, bright with road rage
I'm patient to win the cage and the tin to bounce all around
In surround sound, devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings overall the same thing

Sing-song karaoke copy madness
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension, combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention ('tention)

Meant to put you away with the pencil, pistol, official
Sixteen-line, rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spin rah blah blah blah, you can say you saw

It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage, you can't shake the shock

134,place for my head,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/5495420/Linkin+Park/Place+for+My+Head,"I watch how the moon
Sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do
Favors then rapidly, you just
Turn around and start asking me about
Things you want back from me
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd
Wear out your welcome now you see
How quiet it is all alone
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Stay away

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (stay)
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (a-)

The cold comes, racing through my skin
Searching for a way to get to you
Through the storm you
Go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known
You are not alone

With arms up, stretched into the sky
With eyes like, echoes in the night
Hiding from the hell that you've been through
Silent one, you
Go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known

You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known

Disjointed heart
I've got no commitment to my own flesh and blood
Left all alone
Far from my home
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart

I keep it locked up inside

I cannot express to the point I've regressed
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed

I keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies

It's too late to love me now
You have never shown me
It's too late to love me now
You don't even know me

Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (break)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (me)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (too)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (break)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (me)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (too)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance

Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
Cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift
Dog-paddle through a bog of shadows and smog
With my thought catalog, analog, rap battle log
Keep my distance, and fear resistance, hurt by persistence
The twisted web of tangled lies strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes 
Against the state of being, feeling the weightlessness
Press me to the ceiling, reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound
Tuned to the frequency making your chest shake with every boom
Involuntary muscle contraction
Ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria
The sound pounds to make the dead flush
To hand you a head rush with read rhymes and said stuff"
137,part of me,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/31665693/Linkin+Park/Part+of+Me,"Part of me won't go away
Every day, reminded how much I hate it
Weighted against the consequences
Can't live without it, so it's senseless
Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with a gaping hole
Take control of my life
And wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
You hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, the wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are
And now I'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts
That grate on my sanity
I'd rather not even be 
Than the man that's staring in the mirror through me

Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me

I feel it every day
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it
Once it's been dealt with you feel like
You've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Taken to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know that you can choose to lose
The part in your heart where your insides bruised
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me

I feel it every day
I feel I'm in my way
I feel the swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

Alive in me, inside of me
A part of me screams as I wait silently
Alive in me, inside of me
A part of me screams as I wait silently

This part of me won't go away (alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams as I wait silently)
Part of me won't go away (alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams as I wait silently)

Mmm, mmm, yeah

Everywhere I look around
I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself
There's always something wrong with me

Everywhere I look around
I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself
There's always something wrong with me

I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

I feel it every day
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside

Watch as the room rocks mentally moonwalk
Mixed Media slang, banging in your boom box
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip hop rhymes are childish

You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an MC
With your lack of skill and facility, you're killin' me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility

I heard that some of you are gettin' help with your rhymes
You're not an MC if someone else writes your lines
Rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
'Cause rock and hip hop have collaborated for years

But now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You want to be an MC, you've got to study the skill

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up

So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally you don't have the hip hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top forty (top forty)

And your record company is completely missing it
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate
So in a battle, you can't hack it, react with whack shit
And get smacked with verbal backflips

Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It's taken decades for MCs to establish this
You're new to hip hop and welcome if you're serious
But not on the mic leave that to the experienced

(Using the waves of sound the true master)
(Paralyzes his opponents, leaving him vulnerable to attack)

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up, step up

(After years of painstaking research)
(By the world's leading sound scientists)
(We here at the sound institute have invented)
(A reliable audio weapons system)
(Actual movement of musical sound)
(In space used to carefully attack and neutralize)
(The cellular structure of the human body)
(And the question must be asked)

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up, step up

141,could have been,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/37523373/Linkin+Park/Could+Have+Been,"Alone again, you go away

What do you mean that you don't know?
It's obvious you think you do
You think it's best to choose loneliness
Afraid of what's right in front of you

Go

What can I do when you turn away
Except close the door
And figure out how I'm gonna try again
Play it through to be with you
But alone again it's how it's gonna end

Go (you go)

Making my move so carefully (alone)
Feel it when you stare at me (again)
Making my move so carefully
Feel it when you stare at me
Making my move so carefully (you go)
Feel it when you stare at me
Making my move so carefully (away)
Feel it when you stare at me

We could have been so wrong
Guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out

I can't do anything but say
It won't be the same as yesterday
You say you're afraid to be with me
And I just pray you let the fear go away

Go

And I can't see you as a friend
So now I know how this has got to end
Make it so nobody wins
Ending this before it begins

Go (you go)

Making my move so carefully (alone)
Feel it when you stare at me (again)
Making my move so carefully
Feel it when you stare at me
Making my move so carefully (you go)
Feel it when you stare at me
Making my move so carefully (away)
Feel it when you stare at me

Alone again, you go away

We could have been so wrong

But I guess you'll never find out (could have)
But I guess you'll never find out (been)

142,a  light that never comes,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/30163261/Linkin+Park/A++Light+That+Never+Comes,"Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me
When it rains, it pours, when the floodgates open brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

(Oh)
'Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

(Oh)
Night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I been waiting for it so long

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

Oh
Oh
Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A king can only reign 'til instead
There comes that day it's ""off with his head""

(Oh)
The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

Oh
Oh
Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

And I told them, nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me
When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

Waiting for a light that never comes

Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

Bottom to top I stop
At the core of the rotten
Stop and just what I thought
The sun has escaped us
So I'm bright in the sky
And I'm far from rapist
Look at why did try

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core of the rotten
Stop and just what I thought
The sun has escaped us
So I'm bright in the sky
And I'm far from rapist
Look at why did try

From the thread to the needle, middle to end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes tightly shut looking thought the rust and rotten dust
A spot of light floods the floor
And pours itself upon a world of pretend
Then the eyes ease open and its dark again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core of the rotten
Stop and just what I thought
The sun has escaped us
So I'm bright in the sky
And I'm far from rapist
Look at why did try

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core of the rotten
Stop and just what I thought
The sun has escaped us
So I'm bright in the sky
And I'm far from rapist
Look at why did try

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

Moving all around
Screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as wheels go round the sunset creeps past the
Street lamps, cars, chain-links, and concrete
A wind open grows and captures the eye
Cry's out yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box a rock with the needles on top

Nothing stops in the slanted the chain
The brains lose not knowing they were part of the game
And the insides go but the box stays the same
And shame, shovel up the pieces to the pain
You could try to hide yourself in the world of pretend
When the paper's crumbled up it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core of the rotten
Stop and just what I thought
The sun has escaped us
So I'm bright in the sky
And I'm far from rapist
Look at why did try

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core of the rotten
Stop and just what I thought
The sun has escaped us
So I'm bright in the sky
And I'm far from rapist
Look at why did try

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

Yeah I got you got in the act
You better step back
Telling me that
I seein' right through you (x8)

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up"
144,dedicated (1999 demo),https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/14594480/Linkin+Park/Dedicated+%281999+Demo%29,"I have a dream of a scene between the green hills
Clouds pull away and the sunlight's revealed
People don't talk about keeping it real
It's understood that they actually will
And intoxicated and stimulated emcees
Staring in the trees, paranoid, or caught in the breeze
Watch them flee, hip-hop hits
Take a walk with me and what you'll see
Is a land where the sand is made up of crushed up wax
And the sky beyond you is krylon blue
And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme
And emcees have left materialism behind them
Meanwhile I just grip my mic
And hope me and my team make it through alright
Because say what you will, and say what you might
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night

Because this is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to where the music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same
And dedicated to the people advanced in the game
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun

I've seen a lot of shit, I've talked to a bum
Out on sunset strip, he asked me How would you feel
If everybody acted like you didn't exist
You'd lose your grip, probably eventually flip.
So let it be known, the only reason that we do this
So that you can pick it up and just bang your head to it
While emcees fight to see who can be the commonist
Be floatin overhead like a space odyssey monolith
Over seeing the game, over being part of the same old thing
It's all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain
And acidic rain and promises that you won't do it again
Meanwhile I just grip my mic
And hope me and my team make it through alright
Because say what you will, and say what you might
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night

Because this is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to where the music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same
And dedicated to the people advanced in the game
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun

Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide

This is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to where the music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same
And dedicated to the people advanced in the game
What's real, everybody who doesn't feel safe
What's real, everybody who knows they're out of place
What's real, anybody with nowhere to run
Will hide in the shadows waiting for the sun"

Do I follow my fate to escape blindly
Do I hide my pride away from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
Do I let it go and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust none and live life in loneliness
Because sunlight burns the skin of sleeping men
I make the right turns but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again by myself (myself)
I ask why (but in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why (but in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(When put against you, I cant win)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to give in to fate seems senseless
If I hide my pride and lie sleepless
I wont be able to cope with my weakness
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer
By myself (myself)

I'm always afraid that I'm now out of touch
How do you expect that I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to

Don't you (know)
I can't tell you how to make it (go)

Like these simple thoughts, you swallow them whole

Her secret disguised behind the lies
And at night she cries away her pride
With eyes shut tight
Staring at her inside

All her friends know why she can't sleep at night
All her family asking if she's alright
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell
Well all shes gotta do is stop kidding herself

She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long

Just why you run
So far away, far away

Says he's got it all under control
Thinks he knows its not a problem he's stuck with
But in reality
It'd be a problem to just quit
An addict and he can't hold the reins
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem he's got
But cant get off the carousel until he makes it stop

He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long

Try to be closer to me and I'll save you
Fly with me under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you

Just follow me

And i'll show you what you wanna see

And what I said still stuck in my head
But misled
Thinking the things I do would make you never wanna come back
But an all front attacks, you could never run from that
Being trapped in this with you, something that I never wanted to do
But through it all you've got to see that where I want to be
Is over the pen again letting it out of me
In the center of the day in the dream, seeing all my thoughts
Getting lost in between, realizing one, not the way that it seems
And the killing and the killer with a head full of screams

I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I live for them
(start seeing it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

We're gonna be crushed when it all falls apart
Knowing no matter how low, hoping that you won't know
The strain it puts to me, seeing what you've done
And consequently I've run away, just hidden again
Within the boundaries of an anguish
Don't want me to say this, but you're dragging me down
Lost in the chaos being tossed around

Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic
Hope that some day you'll regret this
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time
Adding to the panic of my confine

Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic
Hope that some day you'll regret this
