Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a silence apart 

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

1,hymn for the weekend,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/33468912/Coldplay/Hymn+for+the+Weekend,"Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)
Then we'll shoot across the (symphony)
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)
Then we'll shoot across the (oh-ah-oh-ah)
Symphony
(So high, so high)
Then we'll shoot across the sky

Oh, angels sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was hurt, withered, dried up
You came to rain a flood

So drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
We're on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
(Woo)
(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

Oh, angels sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah

Then we'll shoot across the"
2,viva la vida,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/37071470/Coldplay/Viva+La+Vida,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"
3,christmas lights,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/36634023/Coldplay/Christmas+Lights,"Christmas night, another fight
Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood

I took my feet
To Oxford Street
Trying to right a wrong
Just walk away
Those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they float
And I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope

Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved ya darling
And I always will

Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on

Oh Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights keep shining on"
4,kaleidoscope,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/33795926/Coldplay/Kaleidoscope,"This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival

A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor

Welcome and entertain them all!
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide"
5,everyday life,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/36676011/Coldplay/Everyday+Life,"What in the world are we going to do?
Look at what everybody's going through
What kind of world do you want it to be?
Am I the future or the history?

'Cause everyone hurts
Everyone cries
Everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
Everyone falls
Everybody dreams and doubts
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out

How in the world I am going to see?
You as my brother
Not my enemy?

'Cause everyone hurts
Everyone cries
Everyone sees the color in each other's eyes
Everyone loves
Everybody gets their hearts ripped out
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out
Hold tight for everyday life
Hold tight for everyday life

At first light
Throw my arms out open wide
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Yes"
6,a message,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/33017712/Coldplay/A+Message,"My song is love
Love to the loveless, shown
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone

Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And its so hard to see you clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
Well I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
Your the target that I'm aiming at
And I get that message home

My song is love
My song is love, unknown
And I'm on fire for you, clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
Your the target that I'm aiming at
But I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

And I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until its much too late
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home

My song is love, is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home"

I was lost, oh yeah 

Yeah how long must you wait for it?
Yeah how long must you pay for it?

9,fix you,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/36883330/Coldplay/Fix+You,"When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

When the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
If you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from all my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you"

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka

Rosaleem of the damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon
She went, ""Woo woo, woo woo ooh ooh ooh""
Indigo go up to heaven today
""Woo woo, woo woo ooh ooh ooh""
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
She say

I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again

Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune
And he went ""Woo woo, woo woo ooh ooh ooh""
Tulips the color of honey today
It's true true, woo woo ooh ooh ooh
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
He say

I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again (yeah)

Woo woo, woo woo ooh ooh ooh
Woo woo, woo woo ooh ooh ooh
Cherubim, Seraphim soon
Come sailing us home by the light of the moon

Oh I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and feel home again

Woo woo, woo woo ooh ooh ooh
I guess we'll be raised on our own then
Woo woo, woo woo ooh ooh ooh
I want to be with you 'til the world ends
I want to be with you 'til the whole world ends

Two raindrops in the same sea
You could be me, I could be you
Two angles of the same view
And we share the same blood

Comme deux gouttes d'eau
On se ressemble
Comme provenant de la même mère
Comme deux ruisseaux (You could be me)
Qui se rassemblent (I could be you)
Pour faire les grandes rivières
And we share the same blood
Yeah, we share the same blood

And we share the same blood

12,something just like this,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/33924129/Coldplay/Something+Just+Like+This,"I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not lookin' for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairy-tale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this

I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not lookin' for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairy-tale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss

I want something just like this
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this

13,clocks,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/22901805/Coldplay/Clocks,"The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead
Singin' come out of things un said
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'

You are
You are

Confusion that never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singin' come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'

You are
You are
You are
You are

You are
You are

And nothing else compares
Oh, no, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go"

A spider web it's tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I said
Oh no what's this
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
The thought of all the stupid things I've done

And I never meant to cause you trouble
And and I never meant to do you wrong
And ah well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no I never meant to do you harm

Oh no I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
Here am I in my little bubble

Singing out
I never meant to cause you trouble
And I never meant to do you wrong
And ah well if I ever caused you trouble

I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favourite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

Oh
It was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall
A wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall"

19,paradise,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/34797400/Coldplay/Paradise,"When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)

She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, ""Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the sun must set to rise""

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh

I haven't slept
I think I do
But I don't forget
My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try my heart stays still
It never moves
Just won't be led

And you're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head

Always in my

Still, I call it magic, such a precious truth

And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Wanna fall, I fall so far
I wanna fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
Call it magic

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
Still believe in magic?
Well yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Of course I do"
22,everglow,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/33795929/Coldplay/Everglow,"We see people coming
See people go
This particular timing is extra special
I know you might be gone
And the world may not know
Still, I see you celestial

Like a lion you ran
Goddess, he wrote
Like an eagle, you circle
Perfect of all
So how come things move on?
How come cars don't slow?
When it feels like the end of the world
When I should but I can't let you go

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadows
There's a feeling of ever, everglow

We're brothers in that
The sisters you write
When we stroll on like that
Be friends 'til we die
With the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life is shortest in fall, in the snow
I know I'm going to miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
Yeah, all alone, the sun
And I know that you're with me
And the way you will show, when you're with me wherever I go
But you give me this feeling, it's everglow

What I wouldn't give for this moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feeling, it's everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you gave me will everglow"

In the swirling of this storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder but bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on"

Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free

I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be the cartoon heart

Light a fire, light a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart

We'll run wild oh
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All that matters that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room is spinning, oh

We'll run wild 
We'll be glowing in the dark

Living innocent wild
We'll be glowing in the dark"

In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

Oh, I think I've landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

And say it's true
It's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams

And you get a head
A head full of dreams
You can see the change you want to
Be what you want to be

When you get a head
A head full of dreams
It's a love, I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh, I think I've landed
Where there are miracles at work
There you've got me open handed
When you got a lost of words

I sing, oh
Oh

Dreaming of escape
Could be up at night

Someone put the fares up
Got me in raise
So guess it's better to stay

Well, come on and say
Well, the food's gonna find us
Just the water and rain
Don't let the fear install
I wanna see you again
I hear you never wanna, sleep all night
Just not falling in love
Stop the ride, come on rage with me

Don't need notes
We'll be birds
To make you look in

Look up this morning
You and me
Get you off your feet

Come on, raise it
Come on raise this noise
One million people, and not one voice
Come on, it's not over
For me, sing loud
Come on, awful love, come away with me
We don't need words

Close your eyes and see
The lumpy boats
Falling free
Fall in love and I missed you

Free as free and free
We'll go through this together
Fly won't you
Won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you're so cool"

Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart she left a hole

The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

And sing slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Like a river to a raindrop, I lost a friend
My drunken as a Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don't let go

And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
And lift off before trouble
Just erodes us in the rain 

Just erodes us in the rain 
Just erodes us and see roses 
In the rain

Sing slow it down
Slow it down

Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world"

It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
Heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes

Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
Heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
But we all fall in love sometimes

We all fall in love sometimes
We all fall in love sometimes
We all fall in love, sometimes"

Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History someone to know
We were moving at the speed of flight

Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

Just an alien

We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line
 
Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
All a lifetime

Just an alien (moving target)
Target movement
Oh, we just want to get home again
Of the space time
Turning forward
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again"

Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me

But I'm trying to turn Ks to Ms what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music, probably
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you're showin' proof
Prove it to them you prove it to yourself 
But honestly its better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent 'til we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, I
We on the verge again and every single day that we deserve

Yeah you could be

You've got fire in your eyes

You can break through those chains 
You'll go higher then we've ever gone

And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through

Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Coming home and I'm finding no peace

And I know, and I know and I know
I know what you've got

So I put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, it's all right

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been in a city but it centered around me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm not

I just put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I reach for it) wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it)yeah yeah wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) and I know, and I know, and I know 
(So I reach for it) I know what I've got
X marks the spot
So I put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the price
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna fly
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure, yeah yeah wherever you are"
41,amazing day,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/34021682/Coldplay/Amazing+Day,"We sat on a roof
Named every star
Shared every bruise and
Showed every scar

Hope has its proof
Your hand in mine, singing
Life has a beautiful, crazy design
And time seemed to say
Forget the world and its weight
And here I just want to stay

Amazing day
Amazing day

We sat on a roof
Named every star and
You showed me a place
Where you can be what you are

And the view
The whole Milky Way
In your eyes
I drifted away
And in your arms
I just want to sway

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh

And I asked can the birds in poetry chime?
Can there be breaks in the chaos of the times?
Oh, thanks God
Must have heard when I prayed
'Cause now I always want to feel this way

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Yeah, today"

Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset

And the red now all the rivers flow
The poppies grow

All your friends they

45,ghost story,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/31493850/Coldplay/Ghost+Story,"Maybe I'm just a ghost
Disappear when anybody's close
Go through you when you travel
Travel over near

Maybe I'm just a ghost
Emptied by 'em, anybody knows
Maybe I'm on a rose
Or am I even here?

Yeah! 

Every time I try to walk through walls
More walls appear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point of trying to raise your voice
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a whisper in a path of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear

Oh, maybe I'm a ghost
Specter on a roller coast
Fallen out of rose
Something people fear

Yeah! 

And every time I thought I walk through walls
It's all become clear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point saying ""Rescue me!""
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

And every time I thought I walk through walls
It's all become clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear"

Won't you come switch me on
Don't know where I've gone
And I, I wish I was here

In a fight, such a fight
You love our fight
I'm not lying, this I swear

How come I'm never there)

Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay

Is just up the road
Show me the way, Lord

In the same game, now why'd you have to go
Have to go and throw it all in my flame

Could have had a castle and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

Could have had a castle and worn a ring,

How can they invade it when it's so complicated?

You just want to get it right sometimes

How many times can you say you can't believe what you learn 
That's how you see the world don't you worry yourself 
You're not gonna give up. 

And there's something missing seems like there's nobody listening 
If you're running in a circle how can you be too careful? 
We don't wanna be man trapped we don't wanna be shrink wrapped 
Ooh we just want to get it right sometimes 
Just want to get it right sometimes 

That's how you see the world 
How many times have you heard but you can't believe a word

Yeah the spotlight, shines upon you
And how could anybody deny you

And it feels so much lighter
Now I met you
And honey you should know
That I could never go on without you

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their mind

I missed the good part, then I realized
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

A warning sign
It came back to haunt me, and I realized
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

Look for me when I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forwards or backwards?
Night turns to day
And I still get no answers

I'm gonna put it six feet underground
He said I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me baby, in the crumbling walls
Oh, I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
Do back the things it did to you in return

Ah, ah, ah, ah

He said I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh, and I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They said start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on

He said I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside my baby, watch the orange glow
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry
You just sit down there and you wonder why
So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh, to the head

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on, as you mean to go on

So meet me by the bridge, meet me by the lane
When am I gonna see that pretty face again
Meet me on the road, meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head"

If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole 

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

And time is on your side
Is on your side; It's on your side now
Not pushing you down, and all around
No it's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to the noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose

You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose"

Is there anywhere you want to go?
You're in control
Is there anything you want to know?
The future's for discovering
The space in which we're traveling

From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass, draw me a map
I'm on the top, I can't get back

Whoa whoa

The first line on the first page
To the end of the last page
From the start in your own way

Somebody listening to what you say
Oh, you just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too
Are they bleeding all your colors into one?

As if you've been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Or if you're stuck in square one"

What if there was no time

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in you life

Oooooooh that's right
Let's take a breath try to put it aside
Ooooooh that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try
Ooooooh that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
That's the risk that you take

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life
That you don't want me there by your side

Oooooooh that's right
Let's take a breath try to put it aside
Ooooooh that's right
How can you know when you don't even try
Ooooooh that's right"

Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan

All this space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up

Maybe you'll stumble upon it

In a permanent state

Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you wanna feel like that

You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up

I've been trying hard to reach you 'cause I don' know what to do
Oh brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future, and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

You can take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or a write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me, how do you feel?
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done
Or do something that's never been done

So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk"

Trying to repair it

I dive in at the deep end
You become my best friend
I want to love you but I don't know if I can
I know something is broken
And I'm trying to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way I can

Before it starts, before I begin? 
How long before you decide? 
Before I know what it feels like? 
Where To, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know.
How long do I have to climb,
Up on the side of this mountain of mine? 

Look up, I look up at night, 
Planets are moving at the speed of light. 
Climb up, up in the trees, 
Every chance that you get, 
Is a chance you seize.
How long am I gonna stand,
With my head stuck under the sand? 
I'll start before I can stop, 
Before I see things the right way up. 

All that noise, and all that sound, 
All those places I have found. 
And birds go flying at the speed of sound, 
To show you how it all began. 
Birds came flying from the underground, 
If you could see it then you'd understand? 

Ideas that you'll never find, 
All the inventors could never design. 
The buildings that you put up, 
Japan and China all lit up. 
The sign that I couldn't read, 
Or a light that I couldn't see, 
Some things you have to believe, 
But others are puzzles, puzzling me. 

All that noise, and all that sound, 
All those places I have found. 
And birds go flying at the speed of sound, 
To show you how it all began. 
Birds came flying from the underground, 
If you could see it then you'd understand, 
Ah when you see it then you'll understand?

All those signs, I knew what they meant.
Some things you can invent. 
Some get made, and some get sent,
Birds go flying at the speed of sound, 
To show you how it all began. 
Birds came flying from the underground, 
If you could see it then you'd understand,
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand?"

The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the seas
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any color I can see

All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up
As us

You see the world in black and white
Nothing too bright
You see no meaning to your life
Yes you try
Yes you try

And all you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
And all you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up

And don't you want to see it come soon
Floating in a big white balloon
Or given your own silver spoon

Don't you want to see it come down
Enough of throwing your arms around
And saying not a moment too soon

'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low
Ooh
Yeah I feel low
Oh no
Oh ooh
'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low

Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud 
Oh and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart

And I tried to sing 
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the clouds
Oh and I
Oh and I
I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it's just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh and it's the part
That's the hardest part 
Yeah that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part"

And kept me for yourself
I can only blame myself
You can only blame me

And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
Or swallowed in the sea

You put me on a line
And hung me out to dry
And darling that's when I
Decided to go to sea

You cut me down to size
And opened up my eyes
Made me realize
What I could not see

And I could write a book
The one they'll say that shook
The world, and then it took
It took it back from me

And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea

Ooh, ooh

And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

The streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

Oh what good is it to live
With nothing left to give
Forget but not forgive
Not loving all you see

Oh the streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well that's where I belong

Rivers will run

Hundreds of years in the future

Looking for life on Earth
Don't fight for the wrong side
Say what you feel like
Say how you feel

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards, again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go

Created, then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it
Someone will mess it up
And you are not wrong to
Ask who does this belong to?
It belongs to all of us

You'll go backwards, again
You'll go forwards, again

The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets, they go searching, to see God in their own way
Save the nighttime for your weeping
Your weeping

Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay

So we rode down to the river, where the toiling ghosts spring
For their curses to be broken
We'd go underneath the arches, where the witches are in the saying
There are ghost towns in the ocean
The ocean

Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay

God is in the houses and God is in my head
And all the cemeteries in London
I see God come in my garden, but I don't know what he said
For my heart it wasn't open
Not open

Singing la lalalalala la la
And the night over London lay
Singing la lalalalala la la
There's no light over London today."

No better and no worse

I just got lost
Every river that I've tried to cross
And every door I ever tried was locked
Ooh-Oh, And I'm just waiting till the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off

To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we're gonna get out

Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Oh, oh,
Dreaming of when the morning comes

Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now

One day the sun will come out

To the sea I offer
This heavy load

Locusts will
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner
In a reign of love

Locusts will

I wish I'd spoken
To the reign of love

Now my back's on the line
My back's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool of us in daylight

Yeah we were dying of frustration
Saying ""Lord lead me not into temptation""
But it's not easy when she turns you on
Since they gone

If you'll only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only, God knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness

So, up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop, then they let go
There's only screaming
Let the windows, down
As I crawl to the ground

If you'll only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness."

From the rooftops I remember
There was snow
White snow

Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below

When the future's architecture
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And the fog
Became God

Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft

Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow 
Far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to violet hill
There we sat in snow
All the time she was silent and still

So if you love me
Won't you let me know?

If you love me
Won't you let me know?"

Bring me round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water
What ya say?
It's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing

People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna curve away
It's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue

I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue,
Could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away

Could be blue

Do you ever get the feeling 
That you're missing the mark?
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

Written up in marker on a factory sign
I struggle with the feeling 
That my life isn't mine
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

See the arrow that they shot trying 
To tear us apart took the fire from my belly and 
The beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go

You, ooh, ooh
Oh you, use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

On every street, every car, every surface in nature
And at the streets are rising and you'd rather sing
Don't let them take control
No, we won't let 'em take control

Yes, I feel a little bit nervous
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax
I'm coming 'round to get us
I'm coming 'round when they don't know the facts

So on a concrete canvas and a glow in the dark
On a concrete canvas, I will make you a mark
Armed with the spray can soul
Let me out with the spray can soul

You, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 

'Cause you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Yeah, it's true, when you
Use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Oh and it hurts like heaven"

Hear the crocodiles ticking round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking round the world

This time I know no song
Can stop it slowly burn

If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call
'When you're tired of racing
And you find you never left the start
Come on baby
Don't let it break your heart'

Though heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Try to catch a cannonball
And a slowly burning tide, oh
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck I heard her call

She said 'When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still you never hit the mark, oh
Even in your rains and shadows
Still we're never going to part
Come on baby

Up on the hill across the blue lake

Up on the hill across the blue lake

Start again I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away

The birds they sang, all a choir
Start again a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of gray

The sky is blue dream that lie 'till it's true
Then taken back the punch I threw
My arms turn in oh, those clumsy things
Send me up to that wonderful world
And then I'm up with the birds

Might have to go
Where they don't know my name
Float all over the world
Just to see her again
And I won't show or feel any pain
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain

A simple plot
But I know one day
Good things are coming our way

The wreckage of a universe floats past
Somewhere up above my heart

A government is overthrown
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last

And I heard it on the radio
That one day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a tv show
That somewhere up above
And in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart
Maybe moving us to mars

We won't see the earth again
In these seconds just remain unchanged

Eight to nine, nine to ten
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again you and me
We are meeting for the first time
Can't you see
Seven, six, five, four, three
We are meeting for the first time
Singing this space symphony

They'll be tearing us apart moving us to mars
Past the satellites and stars
They'll be moving us to mars"

Let me in, unlock the door
I never felt this way before

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come

Hold my head inside your hands
I need someone who understands
I need someone, someone who hears
For you, I've waited all these years

For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
Until my day, my day is done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

In your tears and in your blood
In your fire and in your flood
I hear you laugh, I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know what I'll become

For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
Until my days, my days are done
And say you'll come and set me free

Down the corner of my street
Every night there the headlights are glowing
There's a cold war coming
On the radio I heard
Baby, it's a violent world

Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow
I can hear it coming
I can hear the silent sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a-creeping
Oh and time's a loaded gun
(Every road is a ray of light)
It goes on
Time only can lead you on, still it's
Such a beautiful night

Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow
I can hear it coming
Like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Gravity, release me
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground"

Runners, until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even right is wrong

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we are gonna get out

Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Ohh ohh...
Dreaming of when the morning comes

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out

He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
With ripples and the rhymes
He asked will I see heaven in mine?

Oh that is just the way it was
And nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
And they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
With riddles and the rhymes
But will I see heaven in mine?
Oh, oh, oh

Son, don't ask,
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
And Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime
Stars in heaven align
Oh

Son, don't ask,
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

What are we drinking when we're done, just glasses of water"

The sky wore a veil of gold and gray
At night it was the bright of the moon with me
Time was just floating

Then there was rain
This town's foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a bit of a tumbling
And time just floated away
We can watch it and stay and we can listen

Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Then there was rain
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart would've broke again
Times were vicious

Singing, deeper that the knife goes in the more you win
You win but with less than when you begin
Deeper that the knife goes in
Oooooooooooooooh

Ooh, rainy day come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
We're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah
Aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah
Aaaaah aaaah aaaaaah

But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Propekt, how could I forget?

Drums
Here it comes
Don't you wish that life could be as simple,
As fish swimming round in a barrel.
When you've got the gun?

Oh and I'll run
Here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get the anaconda control
When I wasn't one

Here I lie
On my own in a separate sky
Here I lie
On my own in a separate sky
I don't want to die
On my own, here, tonight
Here I lie
On my own in a separate sky"

I don't get what I deserved
No better and no worse

I just got lost
Every river
That I tried to cross
Every door
I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting
'til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause a long may come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost
Every river
That you tried to cross
Every gun
You ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting
Until the firing stopped
Oh and I'm just waiting

Aha, I gotcha, uh,
With the same sword
They knight you,
They gon' good night you with
Shit,
That's only half
If they like you
That ain't even the half
What they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac,
See success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus,
See success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed,
Prepare to be crucified
Media meddles,
Niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take,
They remind you
You're ghetto
So it's tough
Being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then,
You have to be Bobby now
And the question is,
'Is to have had and lost
Better
Than not having at all?'
Because I'm

Oh and I, just waiting
'til the shine wears off
Oh and I, just waiting
'til the shine wears off"

And some sounds you'll feel
So stay 'round
And some sounds you'll feel

And it's me they're looking for
And it's me
I will never survive
But we'll be around some more

Brothers and sisters unite
Its the time of your lives
Its the time of your lives"

Could you tell me whatever
Tie yourself to a mast
It's now or it's never
Could it tear us apart
It'll soon be forever
It's gonna tear us apart

Are monkeys in cages 
That don't have a number 
To fight one another 

Try to recover 
Climb up the ladder 
Look up and you see birds 
Blind as each other 
How long can we suffer? 

We're as blind as each other 
On the cloud that you're sitting 
There's one born every minute 
So much to discover 
I've become a believer 

Sisters and brothers 
Who fight one another 
Will mourn and deceive us 
Will find us and keep us 

Take us or leave us 
How soon is now? yeah 
How long is never? 
I'm nothing but normal 
With something together 

Come on and stick together 
On the cloud that you're sitting 
There's one born every minute 
So much to discover 
I've become a believer"

I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And though I started here
I ran away from you

I'm gonna come on in
And see it through

I ran away from you
That's all I ever do

And when I heard you call to
Come back to me
And though I should stay
I don't have the stomach to

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
There might be nothing left to do
So I ran away from you

I'm gonna come on in
My eyes are closed

I can feel it there
The sun's so close
I'm gonna come on out
And burn the sky

A star arose in my own cage
I'm stuck in line
And in a cage

Just a single star
I sing for

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
And I did not know what to do
And so I ran away from you"

I could be locked in here on my own

Or like a stone that suddenly drops
It never stops, no

I could be lost or I could be saved
Calling out from beneath the waves
Beaten down by the social raves

Never again; never again

Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm screamin' out from the crests of waves

It could be worse; it's all sweet
It could be snapped from the jaws of defeat
Or like a light lit up on the beach
You wear your heart on your sleeve, Ohhhh

You want to stop before you begin
You want to sink when you know you could swim
You want to stop just before you begin
Never give in; never give in

Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm screamin' out from the crests of waves

Except not for the love we make

How little things can slip out of your hands
How often people change, no two remain the same
Why things don't always turn out as you plan

These are things that I don't understand
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand

I can't, and I can't decide
Wrong, all my wrong from right
Day, all my day for night
Dark, all my dark for light
I live, but I love this life

How infinite is space, and who decides your fate
Why everything will dissolve into sand
How to avoid defeat, when truth and fiction meet
Why nothing even turns out how you planned

These are things that I don't understand
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand

I can't, and I can't decide
Wrong, all my wrong from right

When your wheels stop turning
And you feel let down
And it seems like troubles
Have come all around

I can hear that sound
But I can't help thinking
And I won't look now

Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud

I wish that I could work it out

You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the clouds

I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it's just comes undone

To melt into this lake

Of saving my innocence
And this could be my last chance
No more keeping my feet on the ground

Sometimes I feel the chance is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
And I move, and I wake up smiling

Of saving my innocence

Its only your imagination
Its only all the things that you fear
And the things from which you can't escape""

Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others
Oh no

And a book about the colour of coal

Saying, ""What use the metal if the metal don't shine?""
She said, ""Bring me back a diamond ring cause I really want one""

Set a course for a silver sun

Once he really saved my life

Say hey then stay up 'til morning

When I close my eyes
When I close my eyes
I see you, you
When I close my eyes
When I close my eyes
You come through, you
Time just deepens, sweetens
And mends old friends

We all melt back into the picture
Raindrops back into the water, old friends

I hope sweet heaven is the place for me

Aside from all the medicine and health
If you could do it all again, would you do it all the same?
Is there something that you'd tell your former self?
There were those that wished they'd spun upon a jukebox
There were pirates who had never seen the sea
But the one recurring theme, the one recurring dream they had
Was to be whatever they wanted to be

To be Pyotr Tchaikovsky
To be free like everyone else
There will be no flags to warn me, no
'Cause I just wanna be myself

You may telephone in by a ouija
Is there any advice that you could give?
When you know you're not like them, do you know La Varsovienne?
I know that I am living, but can you show me how to live?

And the Holy Roman Army
Said your heart beats like everyone else
And you don't need no flags to tell you who you are, so say
I just wanna be myself

Ooh-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

The melodies inside yourself
And love come pouring out
And everyone's allowed
We're feathered by the crowd

And up there in the heavens
Galileo and those pining for the moon
Know it's a slow burn
Through Pioneer and Helix
Oumamama, Heliopause, and Neptune
We're a slow burning tune
But we'll get there

So for now
In this crazy world, I do
I just want you

In the end, it's all about
The love you're sending out

And up there in the heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto, Calliope
Betelgeuse, the neon moons
We're a slow burning tune
But we'll touch down soon

So will you
And in this crazy world, I do
I just want you

And up there in the heavens
Galileo saw reflections of us too
Pluribus unum, unus mundus
And all the satellites imbue
The purple, yellow, green, red, orange and the blue

There's a man who takes his time
From his homemade cuckoo clock
And he makes us march around it
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock

There's a crocodile cross-eyed
There's a turning of the tide
We're no longer gonna fight for
Some old crook and all his crimes
There's a sewing up of rags
Into revolution flags
Got to stand up to be counted
Be an anthem for your times
It's just work

It's just work, it's not easy
And we could all be blown apart
And Heaven is the fire escape
You try to cling to in the dark

It's just work, believe me

I heard the strangest song
A DJ a star away is
Playing it to turn us on

My heart started glowing
I feel it inside, it's flowing

I say I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed, yeah
Oh I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But from another planet
Still they call us humankind

Today I had the strangest
Feeling that I belong (belong)
(Ay)

Before, I was dying
I feel it inside, now I'm flying

I say I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed, yeah
Oh I know, I know, I know
We're only human

We're only human
But we're capable of kindness
So they call us humankind"

Oooh oooh
Oooh

So we left La Mancha
Heading out for higher plains
Me and Sancho Panza

Looking for adventure
Rocinante at the reigns
'Till the windmills answer

You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely ever again
You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely again
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

So they sent the doctor
For examining my brain
Said he's not too clever

When the world, when the world just seems
A little bit too cruel
Gonna leave it better
Gonna make one better, yeah!

So tell that princess
Tell that princess ""hide down the drain""
Tell that princess she'll never be lonely again
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

Oooh
Oooh
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

Where the people sing
""Ole ole ole ole
Ole ole...""
([The People:] Ole ole ole ole, Coldplay Coldplay...)
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain"

people burying their dead
i ask somebody what the time is
but time doesn't matter to them yet

people talking without speaking
trying to take what they can get
i ask you if you remember
prospekt how could i forget


drums
here it comes
don't you wish that life could be as simple
as fish swimming 'round in a barrel when you've got the gun
oh and i run
here it comes
we're just two little figures in a soup bowl
trying to get the other kind of control
but i wasn't one

but here i lie
on my own in a seperate sky
and here i lie
on my own in a seperate sky
i don't wanna die
on my own here tonight
but here i lie
on my own in a seperate sky"

I'm dreaming of that very special place

In that city where they send you into space

I am dreaming of when I get back to Texas
Corpus Christi, Harris County, Galveston
There's a harmony that comes down there in Houston
Oh Houston, you got to keep on keeping on

From Miami, we're sending love to Houston
We're praying that you make it through the rain
I know nothing's gonna break the will of Houston
Oh and we can't wait to go down there again

Take it Jon!

We had a kind of love
I thought that it would never end
Oh my lover, oh my other, oh my friend

We talked around in circles and
We talked around and then
I loved you to the moon and back again

You gave everything this golden glow
Now turn off all the stars, 'cause this I know
That it hurts like so
To let somebody go

All the storms we weathered
Everything that we went through
Now without you, what on earth am I to do?

When I called the mathematicians and
I asked them to explain
They said love is only equal to the pain

And when everything was going wrong
You could turn my sorrow into song
Oh, it hurts like so
To let somebody go
To let somebody go

Ohh (ohh)
Ohh (let somebody, let somebody go)
(Yeah)

Oh, when you love somebody
When you love somebody
Got to let somebody know
Oh, when you love somebody
When you love somebody
Got to let somebody know

So when you love somebody
When you love somebody
Then it hurts like so
To let somebody go
It hurts like so
To let somebody go

But you're still with me now, I know
(Let somebody, let somebody go)
Oh (let somebody, let somebody go)
But you're still with me now, I know"

Only got a human heart
I wish it didn't run away
I wish it didn't fall apart, oh

My human heart
Night and day and light and dark
Any day it could be torn in half (ooh)
Only got a human heart

Girls can make believe
Girls wear it on the sleeve
Thought I could pretend for trying's sake
Still my heart had to break

My human heart
Only got a human heart
I wish it didn't run away
I wish it didn't fall apart, oh

And falling down on your knees asking for sympathy
And being caught in between all you wish for and all you seen
And trying to find anything you can feel that you can believe in

May God's love be with you
Always
May God's love be with you

I know I would apologize if I could see your eyes
'Cause when you showed me myself I became someone else
But I was caught in between all you wish for and all you need
I picture you fast asleep
A nightmare comes
You can't keep awake

May God's love be with you
Always
May God's love be with you

'Cause if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
If I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
You
You
I'll find you
You

I don't know anymore
What it's for
I'm not even sure
If there is anyone who is in the sun
Will you help me to understand
'Cause I been caught in between all I wish for and all I need
Maybe you're not even sure what it's for
Any more than me

May God's love be with you
Always
May God's love be with you
Always
Always
May God's love be with you

'Cause if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
If I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find
If I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find

I'll find you

I can't let go
To the sea I offer
This heavy load

Locusts will
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner
In a reign of love

Locusts will
Let us stop
I wish I'd spoken
To the reign of love

Reign of love
By the church, we're waiting
Reign of love
My knees go praying

How I wish
I'd spoken up
Or we'd be carried
In the reign of love."
178,trouble in town,https://www.lyrics.com//lyric/36676032/Coldplay/Trouble+In+Town,"Trouble in town, because they cut my brother down
Because my sister can't wear her crown
There's trouble, there's trouble in town

Blood on the beach, oh my goodness
There's blood on the beach
Lore of the jungle, or the lore of the street
There's blood on, there's blood on the beach

And I get no shelter, and I get no peace
And I never get released

Trouble in town, because they hung my brother brown
Because the system just keep it down
This trouble, this trouble in town

And I get no shelter, and I get no peace
And I just get more policed
And I get no comfort, and I get no name
Everything is getting strange

Best friends
What's that?
What's his name?
X (Standby, sir)
Alright, is that X your middle name?
Of course, it's on a vehicle ID, right?
You gettin' smart? 'Cause you'll be in a fucking car with him
Fucking smartass (just tellin' you)
I'm asking you what the X is, is that your middle name?
Of course, what is it?
Don't come back with the ""what is it?"" fucking shit
Talk to these fucking pigs on the street that way
You ain't talking to me that way
I don't talk to nobody in the streets, I don't hang with nobody
Well then don't come to fucking Philadelphia, stay in Jersey
I have family out here
Everybody thinks they're a fucking lawyer and they don't know jackshit
Are you supposed to grab me like this?
Grab you up? I'll grab you any way I got to
You're not protecting me while I'm trying, while I'm trying to go to work
Why don't you shut up?

Love reign o'er me
When I need a friend

And take it from the bums
Take it from the hospitals
And squeeze it from the slums
All the kids make pistols
With their fingers and their thumbs
Advertise a revolution, arm it when it comes
We're cooking up the zeros
We've been doing all the sums
The judgement of this court is
We need more guns
Stop

Everything's gone so crazy
Everything tangled in blue
Everyone's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

Melt down all the trumpets
All the trombones and the drums
Who needs education?
Or a thousand spent at sums
Poor is good for business
Cut the forest, they're so dumb
Only save your look-alikes
And f*ck the other ones

It's the opinion of this board that
We need more guns
Stop

Everything's gone so crazy
Everybody but you
Everything's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too"

Stray dogs to welcome in fights
Go build the cathedrals
The sight of the pilgrims gone nowhere
And millions of cars
They guise a dream in the distance
From promises he'd leave behind
When there was no harvest
He missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars

In Africa
The rivers are perfectly deep and beautifully wide
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
Say it's alright, child, it's alright

In Africa
We dance in the water and hold each other so tight
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say it's alright, child, it's alright

Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Dreamed of his queen by his side
There will be a beautiful sunset
And you'll be a beautiful bride"
